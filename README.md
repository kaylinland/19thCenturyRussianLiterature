# 19th Century Russian Texts: A Corpus for Voyant Tools 

This corpus of digitized Russian texts contains canonical works from the 19th century. Texts were selected for inclusion based on PhD comprehensive examination reading lists compiled from Columbia University, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, the University of Toronto, and Yale University. All texts are in the common domain and were downloaded and compiled from the online site http://lib.ru/LITRA/. 

The corpus is intended to serve as a starting point for textual analysis in Voyant. The list of texts is thus in no way meant to be a comprehensive collection of 19th century Russian literature; rather, it is suggested as a resource for Russian studies scholars to engage in textual analysis and to provoke further textual analysis projects.
