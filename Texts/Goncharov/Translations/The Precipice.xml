<empty-line/>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivan Alexandrovich Goncharov (1812-1891) was one of the leading members</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the great circle of Russian writers who, in the middle of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nineteenth century, gathered around the _Sovremmenik_ (Contemporary)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>under Nekrasov's editorship--a circle including Turgenev, Dostoyevsky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tolstoy, Byelinsky, and Herzen. He had not the marked genius of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>first three of these; but that he is so much less known to the western</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reader is perhaps also due to the fact that there was nothing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sensational either in his life or his literary method. His strength was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the steady delineation of character, conscious of, but not deeply</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>disturbed by, the problems which were obsessing and distracting smaller</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and greater minds.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tolstoy has a characteristically prejudiced reminiscence: "I remember</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>how Goncharov, the author, a very sensible and educated man but a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thorough townsman and an aesthete, said to me that, after Turgenev,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there was nothing left to write about in the life of the lower classes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was all used up. The life of our wealthy people, with their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>amorousness and dissatisfaction with their lives, seemed to him full of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inexhaustible subject-matter. One hero kissed his lady on her palm, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another on her elbow, and a third somewhere else. One man is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>discontented through idleness, another because people don't love him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And Goncharov thought that in this sphere there is no end of variety."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In fact, his greatest success was the portrait of Oblomov in the novel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of that name, which was at once recognised as a peculiarly national</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>character--a man of thirty-two years, careless, bored, untidy, lazy, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gentle and good-natured. In the present work, now translated for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>first time into English, the type reappears with some differences.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky seems to have been "born tired." He has plenty of intelligence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some artistic gifts, charm, and an abundant kindliness, yet he achieves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing, either in work or in love, and in the end fades ineffectually</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out of the story. "He knew he would do better to begin a big piece of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>work instead of these trifles; but he told himself that Russians did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understand hard work, or that real work demanded rude strength, the use</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the hands, the shoulders, and the back," "He is only half a man,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>says Mark Volokov, the wolfish outlaw who quotes Proudhon and talks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about "the new knowledge, the new life." This rascal, whose violent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pursuit of the heroine produces the tragedy of the book, is a much less</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>convincing figure, though he also represents a reality of Russian life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then, and even now.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The true contrast to Raisky of which Goncharov had deep and sympathetic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knowledge is shown in the splendid picture of the two women--Vera, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>infatuated beauty, and Aunt Tatiana, whose agony of motherly concern and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shamed remembrance is depicted with great power. The book is remarkable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as a study in the psychology of passionate emotion; for the western</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reader, it is also delightful for the glimpses it gives of the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Russian country life which is slowly passing away. The scene lies beside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one of the small towns on the Volga--"like other towns, a cemetery ...</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the tranquillity of the grave. What a frame for a novel, if only he knew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what to put in the novel.... If the image of passion should float over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this motionless, sleepy little world, the picture would glow into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enchanting colour of life." The storm of passion does break over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>edge of the hill overlooking the mighty river, and, amid the wreckage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the two victims rise into a nobility that the reckless reformer and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pleasant dilettante have never conceived.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Goncharov had passed many years in Governmental service and had, in fact,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reached the age of thirty-five when his first work, _"A Common</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Story,"_ was published. _"The Frigate Pallada,"_ which followed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is a lengthy descriptive account of an official expedition to Japan and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Siberia in which Goncharov took part. After the publication of _"The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Precipice,"_ its author was moved to write an essay, _"Better Late</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Than Never,"_ in which he attempted to explain that the purpose of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his three novels was to present the eternal struggle between East and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>West--the lethargy of the Russian and the ferment of foreign influences.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Thus he ranged himself more closely with the great figures among his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contemporaries. Two other volumes consist of critical study and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reminiscence.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris Pavlovich Raisky had a vivacious, unusually mobile face. At first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sight he appeared younger than his years. The high, white forehead gave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an impression of freshness and vigour; the eyes blazed one moment with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intelligence, emotion or gaiety, a moment later they wore a meditative,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dreamy expression, then again they looked young, even childlike. At</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other times they evidenced knowledge of life, or looked so weary, so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bored that they betrayed their owner's age; at these times there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appeared between them three furrows, certain indications of time and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knowledge of life. Smooth black hair fell on his neck and half covered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the ears, with here and there silver threads about the temples. His</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>complexion had kept the tints of youth except on the temples and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chin, which were a brownish-yellow colour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was easy to guess from his physiognomy that the conflict between</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>youth and maturity was past, that he had passed the early stages of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>life's journey and that sorrow and sickness had left their marks on him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Only the mouth, with its delicate lines, with the fresh, almost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>childlike smile remained unchanged by age.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had been left an orphan in childhood, and for some time his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indifferent, bachelor guardian had left his education to a relative,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris's aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>This lady was endowed with a rich temperament, but her horizon did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stretch far beyond her own home, where in the tranquil atmosphere of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woods and gardens, in the environment of the family and the estate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris had passed several years. When he grew older his guardian sent him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the High School, where the family traditions of former wealth and of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the connexion with other old noble families faded.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His further development, occupations and inclinations led him still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>further from the traditions of his childhood. Raisky had lived for about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ten years in St. Petersburg; that is to say he rented three pleasant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rooms from a German landlord, which he retained, although after he had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>left the civil service he rarely spent two successive half-years in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>capital.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had left the civil service as casually as he had entered it, because,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when he had had time to consider his position, he came to the conclusion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that the service is not an aim in itself, but merely a means to bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>together a number of men who would otherwise have had no justification</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for their existence. If these men had not existed, the posts which they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>filled need never have been created.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now, he had already passed his thirtieth year, and had neither sowed nor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reaped. He did not follow the same path as the other ordinary arrival</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from the interior of Russia, for he was neither an officer nor an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>official, nor did he seek a career for himself by hard work or by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>influence. He was inscribed in the registers of his police district as a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>civil servant.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It would have been hard for the expert in physiognomy to decipher</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky's characteristics, inclinations and character from his face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>because of its extraordinary mobility. Still less could his mental</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>physiognomy be defined. He had moments when, to use his own expression,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he embraced the whole world, so that many people declared that there was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no kinder, more amiable man in existence. Others, on the contrary, who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>came across him at an unfortunate moment, when the yellow patches on his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face were most marked, when his lips were drawn in a sinister, nervous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quiver, and he returned kindness and sympathy with cold looks and sharp</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>words, were repelled by him and even pursued him with their dislike.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Some called him egotistic and proud, while others declared themselves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enchanted with him; some again maintained that he was theatrical, others</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that he was not to be trusted. Two or three friends judged otherwise. "A</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>noble nature," they said, "most honourable, but with all its virtues,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nervous, passionate, excitable, fiery tempered...." So there had never</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been any unanimous opinion of him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Even in early childhood while he lived with his aunt, and later, after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his school-days had begun, he showed the same enigmatic and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contradictory traits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It might be expected that the first effort of a new boy would be to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>listen to the teacher's questions and the pupils' answers. But Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stared at the teacher, as if seeking to impress on his memory the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>details of his appearance, his speech, how he took snuff; he looked at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his eyebrows, his beard, then at his clothes, at the cornelian seal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suspended across his waistcoat, and so on. Then he would observe each of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the other boys and note their peculiarities, or he would study his own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>person, and wonder what his own face was like, what the others thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of him....</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What did I say just now?" interrupted the master, noticing Boris's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wandering glance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>To the teacher's amazement Boris replied word for word, "And what is the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>meaning of this?" He had listened mechanically, and had caught the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>actual syllables.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The master repeated his explanation, and again Boris caught the sound of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his voice, noticing that sometimes he spoke shortly, staccato--sometimes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drawled as if he were singing, and then rapped out his words smartly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like nuts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky blushed, perspired with anxiety, and was silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was the mathematical master. He went to the blackboard, wrote up the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>problem, and again began the explanation. Raisky only noticed with what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rapidity and certainty he wrote the figures, how the waistcoat with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cornelian seal and then the snuff-spattered shirt front came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nearer--nothing, except the solution of the problem, escaped him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now and then a notion penetrated to his brain, but when it came to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>equations he grew weary with the effort required. Sometimes the teacher</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lost patience with him, and generally concluded: "Go back to your place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you are a blockhead."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But if a whiff of originality passed over the master himself, if he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>taught as if it were a game, and had recourse neither to his book nor to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the blackboard, then the solution flashed on Raisky, and he found the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>answer quicker than any of the others.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He consumed passionately history, novels and tales; wherever he could he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>begged for books. But he did not like facts or theories or anything that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drew him from the world of fancy towards the world of reality. In the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>geography lesson he could not understand how any boy could answer in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>class, but once out of class he could talk about foreign countries and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cities, or about the sea, to the amazement of his classmates. He had not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>learnt it from the teacher or from a book, but he gave a picture of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>place as if he had actually been there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are inventing," a sceptical listener would say. "Vassili Nikitich</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never said that."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His companions did not know what to make of him, for his sympathies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>changed so often that he had neither constant friends nor constant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enemies. One week he would attach himself to one boy, seek his society,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sit with him, read to him, talk to him and give him his confidence. Then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for no reason, he would leave him, enter into close relations with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another boy, and then as speedily forget him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>If one of his companions annoyed him he became angry with him and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pursued hostilities obstinately long after the original cause was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forgotten. Then suddenly he would have a friendly, magnanimous impulse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would carefully arrange a scene of reconciliation, which interested</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everyone, himself most of all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he was out of school, everyday life attracted him very little; he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cared neither for its gayer side nor its sterner activities. If his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guardian asked him how the corn should be threshed, the cloth milled or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>linen bleached, he turned away and went out on to the verandah to look</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out on the woods, or made his way along the river to the thicket to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>watch the insects at work, or to observe the birds, to see how they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alighted, how they sharpened their beaks. He caught a hedgehog and made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a playmate of it, went out fishing all day long with the village boys,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or listened to the tales about Pugachev told by a half-witted old woman</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>living in a mud hut, greedily drinking in the most singular of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>horrible incidents she related, while he looked into the old woman's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>toothless mouth and into the caverns of her fading eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For hours he would listen with morbid curiosity to the babble of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>idiot Feklusha. At home he read in the most desultory way. He deemed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>secrets of Eastern magic, Russian tales and folk-lore, skimmed Ossian,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tasso, Homer, or wandered with Cook in strange lands. If he found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing to read he lay motionless all day long, as if he were exhausted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with hard work; his fancy carried him beyond Ossian and Homer, beyond</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the tales of Cook, until fevered with his imaginings he rose tired,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exhausted, and unable for a long time to resume normal life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>People called him an idler. He feared this accusation, and wept over it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in secret, though he was convinced that he was no idler, but something</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>different, that no one but himself comprehended.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no one to guide him in a definite direction. On</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the one hand, his guardian merely saw to it that his masters came at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stated times and that Boris did not avoid school; on the other, his aunt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contented herself with seeing that he was in good health, ate and slept</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>well, was decently dressed, and as a well-brought-up boy should, did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consort with every village lout.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nobody cared to see what he read; his aunt gave him the keys of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>father's library in the old house, where he shut himself in, now to read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Spinoza, now a novel, and another day Voltaire or Boccaccio.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He made better progress in the arts than in the sciences. Here too he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had his tricks. One day the teacher set the pupils to draw eyes, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky grew tired of that, and proceeded to add a nose and a moustache.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The master surprised him, and seized him by the hair. When he looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>closer at the drawing, however, he asked: "Where did you learn to do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nowhere," was the reply.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But it is well done, my lad. See yourself what this hurry to get on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leads to; the forehead and nose are good enough, but the ear you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>put in the wrong place, and the hair looks like tow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky was triumphant. The words, "But it is well done; the forehead and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nose are good enough," were for him a crown of laurel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He walked round the school yard proud in the consciousness that he was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the best in the drawing class; this mood lasted to the next day, when he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>came to grief in the ordinary lessons. But he conceived a passion for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drawing, and during the month that followed drew a curly-headed boy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then the head of Fingal. His fancy was caught by a woman's head which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hung in the master's room; it leaned a little towards one shoulder, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked away into the distance with melancholy, meditative eyes. "Allow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me to make a copy," he begged with a gentle, tremulous voice, and with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nervous quiver of the upper lip.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't break the glass," the master warned him, and gave him the picture.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris was happy. For a whole week his masters did not secure a single</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intelligent answer from him. He sat silently in his corner and drew. At</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>night he took the drawing to his bedroom, and as he looked into its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gracious eyes, followed the lines of the delicately bent neck, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shivered, his heart stood still, there was a catch in his breath, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>closed his eyes; with a faint sigh he pressed the picture to his breast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where the breath came so painfully--and then there was a crash and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glass fell clattering on the floor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he had drawn the head his pride knew no bounds. His work was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exhibited with the drawings of pupils of the top class, the teacher had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made few corrections, had only here and there put broad strokes in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shading, had drawn three or four more decided lines, had put a point in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>each eye--and the eyes were now like life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How lifelike and bold it is!" thought Raisky, as he looked at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strokes inserted by his master, and more especially at the points in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes, which had so suddenly given them the look of life. This step</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forward intoxicated him. "Talent! Talent!" sang in his ears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He sketched the maids, the coachman, the peasants of the countryside. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was particularly successful with the idiot Feklusha, seated in a cavern</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with her bust in the shade, and the light on her wild hair; he had not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the patience nor the skill to finish bust, hands and feet. How could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anybody be expected to sit still all the morning, when the sun was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shedding its rays so gaily and so generously on stream and meadow?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Within three days the picture had faded in his imagination, and new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>images were thronging his brain. He would like to have drawn a round</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dance, a drunken old man, the rapid passage of a troОka. For two days he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was taken up with this picture, which stood before his mind's eye in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>every detail; the peasants and the women were finished, but not the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>waggon with its three fleet horses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In a week he had forgotten this picture also.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He loved music to distraction. At school he had an enduring affection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the dull Vassyvkov, who was the laughing stock of the other boys. A</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>boy would seize Vassyvkov by the ear, crying, "Get out, stupid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blockhead," but Raisky stood by him, because Vassyvkov, inattentive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sleepy, idle, who never did his work even for the universally beloved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Russian master, would every afternoon after dinner take his violin, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as he played, forget the school, the masters and the nose-pullings. His</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes as they gazed into the distance, apparently seeking something</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strange, enticing, and mysterious, became wild and gloomy, and often</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>filled with tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He was no longer Vassyvkov, but another creature. His pupils dilated,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his eyes ceased to blink, becoming clearer and deeper; his glance was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>proud and intelligent; his breath came long and deep. Over his face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stole an expression of happiness, of gentleness; his eyes became darker</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and seemed to radiate light. In a word he became beautiful.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky began to think the thoughts of Vassyvkov, to see what he saw. His</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surroundings vanished, and boys and benches were lost in a mist. More</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>notes ... and a wide space opened before him. A world in motion arose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He heard the murmur of running streams, saw ships, men, woods, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drifting clouds; everywhere was light, motion, and gaiety. He had the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sensation that he himself was growing taller, he caught his breath....</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The dream continued just so long as the notes were heard. Suddenly he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heard a noise, he was awakened with a start, Vassyvkov had ceased to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>play; the moving, musical waves vanished, and there were only the boys,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>benches and tables. Vassyvkov laid aside his violin, and somebody</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tweaked his ear. Raisky threw himself in a rage on the offender, struck</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him--all the while possessed by the magic notes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Every nerve in his body sang. Life, thought, emotion broke in waves in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the seething sea of his consciousness. The notes strike a chord of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>memory. A cloud of recollection hovers before him, shaping the figure of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a woman who holds him to her breast. He gropes in his consciousness--it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was thus that his mother's arms cradled him, his face pressed to her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breast ... her figure grows in distinctness, as if she had risen from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the grave....</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had begun to take lessons from Vassyvkov. For a whole week he had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been moving the bow up and down, but its scratching set his teeth on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>edge. He caught two strings at once, and his hand trembled with weakness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was clearly no use. When Vassyvkov played his hand seemed to play of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>itself. Tired of the torment, Raisky begged his guardian to allow him to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>take piano lessons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It will be easier on the pianoforte," he thought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His guardian engaged a German master, but took the opportunity of saying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a few words to his nephew.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Boris," he said, "for what are you preparing yourself? I have been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intending to ask you for a long time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris did not understand the question, and made no answer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are nearly sixteen years old, and it is time you began to think of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>serious things. It is plain that you have not yet considered what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>faculty you will follow in the University, and to which branch of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>service you will devote yourself. You cannot well go into the army,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>because you have no great fortune, and yet, for the sake of your family,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>could hardly serve elsewhere than in the Guards."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris was silent, and watched through the window how the hens strutted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about, how the pigs wallowed in the mire, how the cat was stalking a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pigeon....</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am speaking to you seriously, and you stare out of the window. For</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what future are you preparing yourself?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I want to be an artist."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wha-at?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"An artist."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The devil only knows what notions you have got into your head. Who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would agree to that? Do you even know what an artist is?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky made no answer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"An artist ... is a man who borrows money from you, or chatters foolish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nonsense, and drives you to distraction.... Artist! ... These people</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lead a wild gipsy life, are destitute of money, clothes, shoes, and all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the time they dream of wealth. Artists live on this earth like the birds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of heaven. I have seen enough of them in St. Petersburg: bold rascals</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who meet one another in the evening dressed in fantastic costumes, lie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>upon divans, smoke pipes, talk about trifles, read poetry, drink brandy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and declare that they are artists. Uncombed, unwashed...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have heard, Uncle, that artists are now held in high esteem. You are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thinking of the past. Now, the Academy produces many famous people."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not very old, and I have seen the world. You have heard the bells</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ring, but do not know in what tower. Famous people! There are famous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>artists as there are famous doctors. But when do they achieve fame? When</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do they enter the service and reach the rank of Councillor? If a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>builds a cathedral or erects a monument in a public place, then people</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>begin to seek him out. But artists begin in poverty, with a crust of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bread. You will find they are for the most part freed serfs, small</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tradespeople or foreigners, or Jews. Poverty drives them to art. But</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you--a Raisky! You have land of your own, and bread to eat. It's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pleasant enough to have graceful talents in society, to play the piano,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to sketch in an album, and to sing a song, and I have therefore engaged</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a German professor for you. But what an abominable idea to be an artist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by profession! Have you ever heard of a prince or a count who has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>painted a picture, or a nobleman who has chiselled a statue? No, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What about Rubens? He was a courtier, an ambassador...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where have you dug that out? Two hundred years ago.... Among the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Germans ... but you are going to the University, to enter the faculty of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>law, then you will study for the service in St. Petersburg, try to get a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>position as advocate, and your connexions will help you to a place at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>court. And if you keep your eyes open, with your name and your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>connexions, you will be a Governor in thirty years' time. That is the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>career for you. But there seem to be no serious ideas in your head; you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>catch fish with the village boors, have sketched a swamp and a drunken</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beggar, but you have not the remotest idea of when this or that crop</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should be sown, or at what price it is sold."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky trembled. His guardian's lecture affected his nerves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Like Vassyvkov, the music master began to bend his fingers. If Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had not been ashamed before his guardian he would not have endured the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>torture. As it was he succeeded in a few months, after much trouble, in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>completing the first stages of his instruction. Very soon he surpassed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and surprised the local young ladies by the strength and boldness of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>playing. His master saw his abilities were remarkable, his indolence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>still more remarkable.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>That, he thought, was no misfortune. Indolence and negligence are native</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to artists. He had been told too that a man who has talent should not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>work too hard. Hard work is only for those with moderate abilities.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky entered the University, and spent the summer vacation with his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aunt, Tatiana Markovna Berezhkov.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His aunt lived in a family estate which Boris had inherited from his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mother--a piece of land on the Volga, close by a little town, with fifty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>souls and two residences, one built of stone and now neglected, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other a wooden building built by Boris's father. In this newer house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna lived with two orphan girls of six and five years old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>respectively, who had been left in her care by a niece whom she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loved as a daughter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna had an estate and a village of her own, but after the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>death of Raisky's parents she had established herself on their little</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>estate, which she ruled like a miniature kingdom, wisely, economically,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carefully and despotically. She never permitted Boris's guardian to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>interfere in her business, took no heed of documents, papers, or deeds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but carried on the affairs of the estate according to the practice of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>its former owners. She told Boris's guardian that all the documents,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>papers and deeds were inscribed in her memory, and that she would render</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>account to Boris when he came of age; until that day came she, according</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the verbal instructions of his parents, was mistress of the estate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris's guardian was content. It was an excellent estate, and could not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be better administered than by the old lady.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>What a Paradise Raisky evolved for himself in this corner of the earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from which he had been taken away in his childhood and where he had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spent many a summer visit in his schooldays. What views in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neighbourhood! Every window in the house framed a lovely landscape. From</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one side could be seen the Volga with its steep banks; from the others</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wide meadows and gorges, and the whole seemed to melt into the distant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blue hills. From the third side could be seen fields, villages, and part</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the town. The air was cool and invigorating, and as refreshing as a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bathe on a summer day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of the two houses the great park, with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>its dark alleys, arbours and seats, was kept in good order, but beyond</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these limits it was left wild. There were broad stretching elms, cherry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and apple trees, service trees, and there were lime trees intended to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>form an avenue, which lost itself in a wood in the friendly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neighbourhood of pines and birches. Suddenly the whole ended in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice, thickly overgrown with bushes, which overhung a plain about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one and a-half versts in breadth along the banks of the Volga.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nearer the wooden house lay the vegetable garden, and just in front of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>its windows lay the flower garden. Tatiana Markovna liked to have a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>space clear of trees in front of the house, so that the place was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flooded with sunshine and the scent of flowers. From the other side of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the house one could watch all that was going on in the courtyard and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>could see the servants' quarters, the kitchens, the hayricks, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stable. In the depths of the courtyard stood the old house, gloomy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>always in shadow, stained with age, with here and there a cracked window</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pane, with heavy doors fastened by heavy bolts, and the path leading up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to it overgrown with grass. But on the new house the sun streamed from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning to night; the flower garden, full of roses and dahlias,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surrounded it like a garland, and the gay flowers seemed to be trying to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>force their way in through the windows. Swallows nesting under the eaves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flew hither and thither; in the garden and the trees there were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hedge-sparrows, siskins and goldfinches, and when darkness fell the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nightingale began to sing. Around the flowers there were swarms of bees,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>humble-bees, dragon-flies, and glittering butterflies; and in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>corners cats and kittens stretched themselves comfortably in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sunshine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the house itself peace and joy reigned. The rooms were small, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cosy. Antique pieces of furniture had been brought over from the great</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house, as had the portraits of Raisky's parents and grandparents. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>floors were painted, waxed and polished; the stoves were adorned with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old-fashioned tiles, also brought over from the other house; the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cupboards were full of plate and silver; there were old Dresden cups and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>figures, Chinese ornaments, tea-pots, sugar-basins, heavy old spoons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Round stools bound with brass, and inlaid tables stood in pleasant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>corners.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In Tatiana Markovna's sitting-room stood an old-fashioned carved bureau</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a mirror, urns, lyres, and genii. But she had hung up the mirror,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>because she said it was a hindrance to writing when you stared at your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>own stupid face. The room also contained a round table where she lunched</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and drank her tea and coffee, and a rather hard leather-covered armchair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a high back. Grandmother [1] was old-fashioned; she did not approve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of lounging, but held herself upright and was simple and reserved in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her manners.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>How beautiful Boris thought her! And indeed she was beautiful.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tall, neither stout nor thin, a vivacious old lady ... not indeed an old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lady, but a woman of fifty, with quick black eyes, and so kind and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gracious a smile that even when she was angry, and the storm-light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flickered in her eyes, the blue sky could be observed behind the clouds.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She had a slight moustache, and, on her left cheek, near the chin, a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>birth-mark with a little bunch of hairs, details which gave her face a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remarkable expression of kindness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She cut her grey hair short, and went about in house, yard, garden with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her head uncovered, but on feast days, or when guests were expected she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>put on a cap. The cap could not be kept in its place, and did not suit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her at all, so that after about five minutes she would with apologies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remove the tiresome headdress.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the mornings she wore a wide white blouse with a girdle and big</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pockets; in the afternoon she put on a brown dress, and on feast days a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heavy rustling silk dress that gleamed like silver, and over it a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>valuable shawl which only Vassilissa, her housekeeper, was allowed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>take out of the press.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Uncle Ivan Kusmich brought it from the East," she used to boast. "It</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cost three hundred gold roubles, and now no money would buy it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At her girdle hung a bunch of keys, so that Grandmother could he heard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from afar like a rattlesnake when she crossed the yard or the garden. At</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sound the coachmen hid their pipes in their boots, because the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mistress feared nothing so much as fire, and for that reason counted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>smoking as the greatest of crimes. The cooks seized the knife, the spoon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or the broom; Kirusha, who had been joking with Matrona, hurried to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>door, while Matrona hurried to the byre.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>If the approaching clatter gave warning that the mistress was returning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the house Mashutka quickly took off her dirty apron and wiped her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hands on a towel or a bit of rag, as the case might be. Spitting on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hands she smoothed down her dry, rebellious hair, and covered the round</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table with the finest of clean tablecloths. Vassilissa, silent, serious,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the same age as her mistress, buxom, but faded with much confinement</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indoors, would bring in the silver service with the steaming coffee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mashutka effaced herself as far as possible in a corner. The mistress</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>insisted on cleanliness in her servants, but Mashutka had no gift for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>keeping herself spotless. When her hands were clean she could do nothing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but felt as if everything would slip through her fingers. If she was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>told to do her hair on Sunday, to wash and to put on tidy clothes, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>felt the whole day as if she had been sewn into a sack. She only seemed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to be happy when, smeared and wet with washing the boards, the windows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the silver, or the doors, she had become almost unrecognisable, and had,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if she wanted to rub her nose or her eyebrows, to use her elbow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa, on the contrary, respected herself, and was the only tidy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman among all the servants. She had been in the service of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mistress since her earliest days as her personal maid, had never been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>separated from her, knew every detail of her life, and now lived with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her as housekeeper and confidential servant. The two women communicated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with one another in monosyllables. Tatiana Markovna hardly needed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>give instructions to Vassilissa, who knew herself what had to be done.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>If something unusual was required, her mistress did not give orders, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suggested that this or that should be done.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa was the only one of her subjects whom Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>addressed by her full name. If she did address them by their baptismal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>names they were names that could not be compressed nor clipped, as for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>example Ferapont or Panteleimon. The village elder she did indeed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>address as Stepan Vassilich, but the others were to her Matroshka,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mashutka, Egorka and so on. The unlucky individual whom she addressed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with his Christian name and patronymic knew that a storm was impending.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here, Egor Prokhorich! where were you all day yesterday?" Or "Simeon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilich, you smoked a pipe yesterday in the hayrick. Take care!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She would get up in the middle of the night to convince herself that a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spark from a pipe had not set fire to anything, or that there was not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>someone walking about the yard or the coachhouse with a lantern.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Under no consideration could the gulf between the "people" and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>family be bridged. She was moderately strict and moderately considerate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kindly, but always within the limits of her ideas of government. If</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Irene, Matrona or another of the maids gave birth to a child, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>listened to the report of the event with an air of injured dignity, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gave Vassilissa to understand that the necessaries should be provided;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and would add, "Only don't let me see the good-for-nothing." After</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Matrona or Irene had recovered she would keep out of her mistress's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sight for a month or so; then it was as if nothing had happened, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>child was put out in the village.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>If any of her people fell sick, Tatiana got up in the night, sent him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spirits and embrocation, but next day she would send him either to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>infirmary or oftener to the "wise woman," but she did not send for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>doctor. But if one of her own relatives, her "grandchildren" showed a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bad tongue, or a swollen face, Kirusha or Vlass must immediately ride</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>post haste to the town for the doctor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The "wise woman" was a woman in the suburbs who treated the "people"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with simple remedies, and rapidly relieved them of their maladies. It</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did, indeed, happen that many a man remained crippled for life after her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>treatment. One lost his voice and could only crow, another lost an eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or a piece of his jawbone, but the pain was gone and he went back to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>work. That seemed satisfactory to the patient as well as the proprietor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the estate. And as the "wise woman" only concerned herself with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>humble people, with serfs and the poorer classes, the medical profession</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not interfere with her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna fed her servants decently with cabbage soup and groats,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on feast-days with rye and mutton; at Christmas geese and pigs were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roasted. She allowed nothing out of the common on the servants' table or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in their dress, but she gave the surplus from her own table now to one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman, now to another.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa drank tea immediately after her mistress; after her came the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>maids in the house, and last old Yakob. On feast days, on account of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardness of their work, a glass of brandy was handed to the coachman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the menservants and the Starost.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As soon as the tea was cleared away in the morning a stout, chubby-faced</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman pushed her way into the room, always smiling. She was maid to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grandchildren, Veroshka and Marfinka. Close at her heels the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>twelve-year-old assistant, and together they brought the children</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to breakfast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Never knowing which of the two to kiss first, Tatiana Markovna would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>begin: "Well, my birdies, how are you? Veroshka, darling, you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brushed your hair?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And me, Granny, me," Marfinka would cry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why are Marfinka's eyes red? Has she been crying?" Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inquired anxiously of the maid. "The sun has dazzled her. Are her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>curtains well drawn, you careless girl? I must see."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the maid's room sat three or four young girls who sat all day long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sewing, or making bobbin lace, without once stretching their limbs all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>day, because the mistress did not like to see idle hands. In the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ante-room there sat idly the melancholy Yakob, Egorka, who was sixteen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and always laughing, with two or three lackeys. Yakob did nothing but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wait at table, where he idly flicked away the flies, and as idly changed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the plates. He was almost too idle to speak, and when the visitors</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>addressed him he answered in a tone indicating excessive boredom or a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guilty conscience. Because he was quiet, never seriously drunk, and did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not smoke, his master had made him butler; he was also very zealous at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>church.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>[1] Tatiana Markovna was addressed by her grand-nieces and her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grand-nephew as Grandmother.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris came in on his aunt during the children's breakfast. Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna clapped her hands and all but jumped from her chair; the plates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were nearly shaken off the table.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Borushka, tiresome boy! You have not even written, but descend like a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thunderclap. How you frightened me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She took his head in her hands, looked for a full minute into his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and would have wept, but she glanced away at his mother's portrait, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sighed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, well!" she seemed to say, but in fact said nothing, but smiled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and wiped away her tears with her handkerchief. "Your mother's boy," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cried, "her very image! See how lovely she was, look, Vassilissa! Do you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remember? Isn't he like her?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>With youthful appetite Boris devoured coffee, tea, cakes and bread, his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aunt watching all the while.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Call the people, tell the Starost and everybody that the Master is here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the real Master, the owner. Welcome, little father, welcome home!" she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said, with an ironic air of humility, laughing and mimicking the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pleasant speech. "Forsake us not with your favour. Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>insults us, ruins us, take us over into your charge.... Ha! Ha! Here are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the keys, the accounts, at your service, demand a reckoning from the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lady. Ask her what she has done with the estate money, why the peasants'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>huts are in ruins. See how the Malinovka peasants beg in the streets of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the town. Ha! Ha! Under your guardian and uncle in the new estate, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>believe, the peasants wear polished boots and red shirts, and live in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>two-storied houses. Well, Sir, why this silence? Why do you not ask for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the accounts? Have your breakfast, and then I will show you everything."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After breakfast Tatiana Markovna took her sunshade, put on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thick-soled shoes, covered her head with a light hood, and went to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>show Boris the garden.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now, Sir, keep your eyes wide open, and if there is anything wrong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>don't spare your Grandmother. You will see I have just planted out the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beds in front of the house. Veroshka and Marfinka play here under my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes, in the sand. One cannot trust any nurse."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They reached the yard.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Kirusha, Eromka, Matroshka, where have you all hidden yourselves? One</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of you come here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Matroshka appeared, and announced that Kirusha and Eromka had gone into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the village to fetch the peasants.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here is Matroshka. Do you remember her? What are you staring there for,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fool. Kiss your Master's hand."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Matroshka came nearer. "I dare not," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris shyly embraced the girl.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have built a new wing to the buildings, Grandmother," he said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You noticed that. Do you remember the old one? It was quite rotten, had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>holes in the floors as broad as my hand, and the dirt and the soot! And</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now look!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They went into the new wing. His aunt showed Boris the alterations in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the stables, the horses and the separate space for fowls, the laundry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and byres.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here is the new kitchen which I built detached so that the kitchen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>range is outside the house, and the servants have more room. Now each</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>has his own corner. Here is the pantry, there the new ice-cellar. What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are you standing there for?" she said, turning to Matrona. "Go and tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Egorka to run into the village and say to the Starost that we are going</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over there."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the garden his aunt showed him every tree and every bush, led him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through the alleys, looked down from the top of the precipice into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brushwood, and went with him into the village. It was a warm day, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the winter corn waved gently in the pleasant breeze.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here is my nephew, Boris Pavlovich," she said to the Starost. "Are you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>getting in the hay while the warm weather lasts? We are sure to have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rain before long after this heat. Here is the Master, the real Master,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my nephew," she said, turning to the peasants. "Have you seen him before,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Garashka? Take a good look at him. Is that your calf in the rye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Iliusha?" she said in passing to a peasant, while her attention already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wandered to the pond.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There they are again, hanging out the clothes on the trees," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remarked angrily to the village elder. "I have given orders for a line</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to be fixed. Tell blind Agasha so. It is she that likes to hang her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things out on the willows. The branches will break...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We haven't a line long enough," answered the Starost sleepily. "We</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shall have to buy one in the town."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why did you not tell Vassilissa? She would have let me know. I go into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the town every week, and would have brought a line long ago."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have told her, but she forgets, or says it is not worth while to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bother the Mistress about it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna made a knot in her handkerchief. She liked it to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said that nothing could be done without her; a clothes-line, for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>instance, could be bought by anybody, but God forbid that she should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trust anybody with money. Although by no means avaricious, she was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sparing with money. Before she brought herself to part with it she was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thoughtful, sometimes angry, but the money once spent, she forgot all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about it and did not like keeping account of it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Besides the more important arrangements, her life was full of small</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>matters of business. The maids had to be put to cutting out and sewing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or to cooking and cleaning. She arranged so that everything was carried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out before her own eyes. She herself did not touch the actual work, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the dignity of age she stood with one hand on her hip and the other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pointing out exactly where and how everything was to be done. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>clattering keys opened cupboards, chests, strong boxes, which contained</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a profusion of household linen, costly lace yellow with age, diamonds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>destined for the dowry of her nieces, and money. The cupboards where tea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sugar, coffee and other provisions were kept were in Vassilissa's charge.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the morning, after coffee, when she had given her orders for the farm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna sat down at her bureau to her accounts, then sat by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>window and looked out into the field, watched the labourers, saw what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was going on in the yard, and sent Yakob or Vassilissa when there was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anything of which she disapproved.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When necessary she drove into the town to the market hall, or to make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>visits, but never was long away, returning always in time for the midday</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>meal. She herself received many guests; she liked to be dispensing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hospitality from morning to night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When in winter afternoons she sat by the stove, she was silent and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thoughtful, and liked everything around her quiet. Summer afternoons she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spent in the garden, when she put on her gardening gloves and took a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spade, a rake, or a watering can, by way of obtaining a little exercise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then she spent the evening at the tea-table in the company of Tiet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikonich Vatutin, her oldest and best friend and adviser.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tiet Nikonich was a gentleman of birth and breeding. He owned in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>province two or three hundred "souls"--he did not exactly know how many,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and never attended to his estate, but left his peasants to do as they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>liked, and to pay him what dues they pleased. Shyly, and without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>counting it, he took the money they brought him, put it in his bureau,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and signed to them to go where they pleased. He had been in the army,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and old people remembered him as a handsome young officer, a modest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>frank young man. In his youth he often visited his mother on the estate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and spent his leave with her. Eventually he took his discharge, and then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>built himself a little grey house in the town with three windows on to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the street, and there established himself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Although he had only received a moderate education in the cadet school,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he liked to read, occupying himself chiefly with politics and natural</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>science. In his speech, his manners and his gait he betrayed a gentle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shyness, never obtruded his dignity, but was ready to show it if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>necessity arose. However intimate he might be with anyone, he always</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>maintained a certain courtesy and reserve in word and gesture. He bowed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the Governor or a friend or a new acquaintance with the same</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old-fashioned politeness, drawing back one foot as he did so. In the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>street he addressed ladies with uncovered head, was the first to pick up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a handkerchief or bring a footstool. If there were young girls in a house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he visited he came armed with a pound of bonbons, a bunch of flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and tried to suit his conversation to their age, their tastes and their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>occupations. He always maintained his delicate politeness, tinged with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the respectful manner of a courtier of the old school. When ladies were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>present he always wore his frock-coat. He neither smoked, nor used</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>perfume, nor tried to make himself look younger, but was always spotless,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and distinguished in his dress. His clothes were simple but dazzlingly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neat. His nankeen trousers were freshly pressed, and his blue frock-coat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked as if it had come straight from the tailor. In spite of his fifty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>years, he had, with his perruque and his shaven chin, the air of a fresh,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rosy-cheeked young man. With all his narrow means he gave the impression</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of wealth and good breeding, and put down his hundred roubles as if he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had thousands to throw about.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For Tatiana Markovna he showed a respectful friendship, but one so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>devoted and ardent that it was evident from his manner that he loved her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beyond all others. But although he was her daily guest he gave no sign</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of intimacy before strangers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She showed great friendship for him, but there was more vivacity in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tone. Those who remembered them when they were young, said she had been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a very beautiful girl. When she had thrown on her shawl and sat looking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>meditatively before her, she resembled a family portrait in the gallery</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the old house. Occasionally there came over her moods which betrayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pride and a desire for domination; when this happened her face wore an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>earnest, dreamy expression, as if she were leading another life far from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the small details of her actual existence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Hardly a day went by that Tiet Nikonich did not bring some present for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother or the little girls, a basket of strawberries, oranges,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>peaches, always the earliest on the market.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At one time it had been rumoured in the town--a rumour long since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stilled--that Tiet Nikonich had loved Tatiana Markovna and Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna him, but that her parents had chosen another husband for her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She refused to assent, and remained unmarried. What truth there was in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this, none knew but herself. But every day he came to her, either at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>midday or in the evening.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He liked to talk over with her what was going on in the world, who was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at war, and with whom, and why. He knew why bread was cheap in Russia;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the names of all the noble houses; he knew by heart the names of all the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ministers and the men in high commands and their past history; he could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell why one sea lay at a higher tide than another; he was the first to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>know what the English or the French had invented, and whether the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inventions were useful or not. If there was any business to be arranged</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the law courts, Tiet Nikonich arranged it, and sometimes concealed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sums that he spent in so doing. If he was found out, she scolded him;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he could not conceal his confusion, begged her pardon, kissed her hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and took his leave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna was always at loggerheads with the bureaucracy of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neighbourhood. If soldiers were to be billeted on her, the roads to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>improved, or the taxes collected, she complained of outrage, argued and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>refused to pay. She would hear nothing about the public interest. In her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opinion everyone had his own business to mind. She strongly objected to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the police, and especially to the Superintendent, who was in her view a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>robber. More than once Tiet Nikonich tried, without success, to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reconcile her to the doctrine of the public interest; he had to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>content if she was reconciled with the officials and the police.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>This was the patriarchal, peaceful atmosphere which young Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>absorbed. Grandmother and the little girls were mother and sisters to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him, and Tiet Nikonich the ideal uncle.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris's aunt had only just begun to give him an idea of her methods of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conducting the estate when he began to yawn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Listen, these are all your affairs; I am only your Starost," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But he could not suppress a yawn, watched the birds, the dragon-flies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>picked the cornflowers, looked curiously at the peasants, and gazed up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at the sky over-arching the wide horizon. Then his aunt began to talk to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one of the peasants, and he hurried off to the garden, ran down to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>edge of the precipice, and made his way through the undergrowth to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>steep bank of the Volga.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is still too young, only a child, does not understand serious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>matters," thought his aunt, as she followed him with her eyes. "What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will become of him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Volga glided quietly between its overgrown banks, with here and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there a sandbank or an island thickly covered with bushes. In the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>distance lay the sandhills and the darkening forest. Here and there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shimmered a sail; gulls, with an even balancing of their wings, skimmed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the water, and then rose with a more strenuous movement, while over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gardens, high in the air, the goshawks hovered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris stood still for a long time, recalling his childhood. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remembered that he had sat on this spot with his mother, looking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thoughtfully out at this same landscape. Then he went slowly back to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house, and climbed the precipice, with the picture of her vividly before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his mind's eye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In Malinovka and the neighbourhood there were tragic memories connected</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with this precipice. In the lifetime of Boris's parents a man wild with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>jealousy, a tailor from the town, had killed his wife and her lover</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there in the midst of the thicket, and had then cut his own throat. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suicide had been buried on the spot where he had committed the crime.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Among the common people, as always happens in cases of this sort, there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were rumours that the murderer, all dressed in white, wandered about the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wood, climbed the precipice, and looked down on town and village before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he vanished into air. And for superstitious reasons this part of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grounds had been left neglected. None of the servants went down the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice, and the peasants from the outskirts of the town and from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Malinovka made a dИtour to avoid it. The fence that divided the Raiskys'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>park from the woods had long since fallen into disrepair. Pines and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bushes of hawthorn and dwarf-cherry had woven themselves together into a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dense growth in the midst of which was concealed a neglected arbour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris vividly imagined the scene, how the jealous husband, trembling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with agitation, stole through the bushes, threw himself on his rival,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and struck him with his knife; how the woman flung herself at his feet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and begged his forgiveness. But he, with the foam of madness on his lips,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>struck her again and again, and then, in the presence of the two corpses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cut his own throat. Boris shuddered. Agitated and gloomy he turned from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the accursed spot. Yet he was attracted by the mysterious darkness of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the tangled wood to the precipice, to the lovely view over the Volga and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>its banks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He closed his eyes, abandoning himself to the contemplation of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>picture; his thoughts swept over him like the waves of the Volga; the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lovely landscape was ever before his eyes, mirrored in his consciousness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Veroshka and Marfinka provided him with amusement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Veroshka was a little girl of six, with dark, brilliant eyes and dark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>complexion, who was beginning to be serious and to be ashamed of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>baby ways. She would hop, skip and jump, then stand still, look shyly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>round and walk sedately along; then she would dart on again like a bird,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pick a handful of currants and stuff them into her mouth. If Boris</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>patted her hair, she smoothed it rapidly; if he gave her a kiss, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wiped it away. She was self-willed too. When she was sent on an errand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she would shake her head, then run off to do it. She never asked Boris</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to draw for her, but if Marfinka asked him she watched silently and more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intently than her sister. She did not, like Marfinka, beg either</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drawings or pencils.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, a rosy little girl of four, was often self-willed, and often</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cried, but before the tears were dry she was laughing and shouting again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Veroshka rarely wept, and then quietly. She soon recovered, but she did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not like to be told to beg pardon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris's aunt wondered, as she saw him gay and serious by turns, what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>occupied his mind; she wondered what he did all day long. In answer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris showed his sketching folio; then he would play her quadrilles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mazurkas, excerpts from opera, and finally his own improvisations.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna's astonishment remained. "Just like your mother," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said. "She was just as restless, always sighing as if she expected</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>something to happen. Then she would begin to play and was gay again. See,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa, he has sketched you and me, like life! When Tiet Nikonich</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>comes, hide yourself and make a sketch of him, and next day we will send</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it him, and it can hang on the study wall. What a boy you are! And you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>play as well as the French emigrИ who used to live with your Aunt. Only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it is impossible to talk to you about the farm; you are still too</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She always wished to go through the accounts with him. "The accounts for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Veroshka and Marfinka are separate, you see," she said. "You need not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>think that a penny of your money goes to them. See...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But he never listened. He merely watched how his aunt wrote, how she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked at him over her spectacles, observed the wrinkles in her face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her birthmark, her eyes, her smile, and then burst out laughing, and,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>throwing himself into her arms, kissed her, and begged to go and look at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the old house. She could refuse him nothing; so she unwillingly gave him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the keys and he went to look at the rooms where he was born and had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spent his childhood, of which he retained only a confused memory.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am going with Cousin Boris," said Marfinka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where, my darling? It is uncanny over there," said Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka was frightened. Veroshka said nothing, but when Boris reached</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the old house, she was already standing at the door, with her hand on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the latch, as if she feared she might be driven away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris shuddered as he entered the ante-room, and cast an anxious glance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the neighbouring hall, supported by pillars. Veroshka had run on in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>front.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where are you off to, Veroshka?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She stood still a moment, her hand on the latch of the nearest door, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he had only just time to follow her before she vanished. Dark,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>smoke-stained reception rooms adjoined the hall. In one were two ghostly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>figures of shrouded statues and shrouded candelabra; by the walls were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ranged dark stained oak pieces of furniture with brass decorations and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inlaid work; there were huge Chinese vases, a clock representing Bacchus</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a barrel, and great oval mirrors in elaborate gilded frames. In the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bedroom stood an enormous bed, like a magnificent bier, with a brocade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cover. Boris could not imagine how any human being could sleep in such a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>catafalque. Under the baldachin hovered a gilded Cupid, spotted and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>faded, with his arrow aimed at the bed. In the corners stood carved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cupboards, damascened with ebony and mother-of-pearl. Veroshka opened a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>press and put her little face inside, and a musty, dusty smell came from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the shelves, laden with old-fashioned caftans and embroidered uniforms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with big buttons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky shivered. "Granny was right!" he laughed. "It is uncanny here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But everything here is so beautiful!" cried Vera, "the great pictures</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the books!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pictures? Books? Where? I don't remember. Bravo, little Veroshka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He kissed her. She wiped her lips, and ran on in front to show him the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books. He found some two thousand volumes, and was soon absorbed in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reading the titles; many of the books were still uncut.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>From this time he was not often to be seen in the wooden house. He did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not even go down to the Volga, but devoured one volume after another.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then he wrote verses, read them aloud, and intoxicated himself with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sound of them; then gave all his time to drawing. He expected something,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he knew not what, from the future. He was filled with passion, with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>foretaste of pleasure; there rose before him a world of wonderful music,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>marvellous pictures, and the murmur of enchanting life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have been wanting to ask you," said Tatiana Markovna, "why you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>entered yourself for school again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not the school, the University!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It's the same thing. You studied at your guardian's, and at the High</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>School, you can draw, play the piano. What more do you want to learn?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The students will only teach you to smoke a pipe, and in the end--which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>God forbid--to drink wine. You should go into the Guards."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Uncle says my means are not sufficient...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not sufficient! What next?" She pointed to the fields and the village.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She counted out his resources in hundreds and thousands of roubles. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had had no experience of army circles, had never lived in the capital,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and did not know how much money was needed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your means insufficient! Why, I can send provision alone for a whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>regiment. No means! What does your Uncle do with the revenues?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I intend to be an artist, Granny."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What! An artist!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When I leave the University, I intend to enter the Academy."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What's the matter with you, Borushka? Make the sign of the cross! Do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you want to be a teacher!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"All artists are not teachers. Among artists there are great geniuses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who are famous and receive large sums for pictures or music."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And do you intend to sell your pictures for money, or to play the piano</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for money in the evenings? What a disgrace!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Grandmother, an artist...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Borushka, don't anger your Grandmother; let her have the joy of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seeing you in your Guard's uniform."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Uncle says I ought to go into the Civil Service."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A clerk! Good heavens! To stoop over a desk all day, bathed in ink, run</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in and out of the courts! Who would marry you then? No, no; come home to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me as an officer, and marry a rich woman!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Although Boris shared neither his uncle's nor his aunt's views, yet for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a moment there shimmered before his eyes a vision of his own figure in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hussar's or a court uniform. He saw how well he sat his horse, how well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he danced. That day he made a sketch of himself, negligently seated in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the saddle, with a cloak over his shoulders.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In Moscow Raisky spent his time partly in the University, partly in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Kremlin gardens. In the evening he sat in the club with his friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hot-headed, good-hearted individuals. Every one of them made a great</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-do, and confidently expected a great future.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At the University, as at school, Raisky paid little attention to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rules of grammar, but observed intently the professor and the students.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But as soon as the lecture touched actual life and brought living men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Romans, Germans or Russians on the scene, whether in history or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>literature, he involuntarily gave the lecturer his attention, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>personages and their doings became real to him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In his second year he made friends with a poor student named Koslov, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>son of a deacon, who had been sent first of all to a seminary, but had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>taught himself Latin and Greek at home, and thus gained admission to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Gymnasium. He zealously studied the life of antiquity, but understood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing of the life going on around him. Raisky felt himself drawn to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this young man, at first because of his loneliness, his reserve,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>simplicity and kindness; later he discovered in him passion, the sacred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fire, profundity of comprehension and austerity of thought and delicacy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of perception--in all that pertained to antiquity. Koslov on his side</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was devoted to Raisky, whose vivacious temperament could not be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>permanently bound by anything. The outcome was the great gift of an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intimate friendship.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In summer Raisky liked to explore the neighbourhood of Moscow. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>explored old convents, examined their dark recesses, the blackened</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pictures of the saints and martyrs; his imagination interpreted old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Russia for him better than the lectures of his professors.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The tsars, monks, warriors and statesmen of the past filed before him as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they lived and moved. Moscow seemed to him to be a miniature tsardom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here was conflict, here the death punishment was carried out; he saw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatars, Cossacks of the Don. The varied life attracted him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In spite of obstacles he passed from one course to another at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>University. He was helped by the reputation for talent he had won by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>certain poems and essays, the subjects of which were drawn from Russian</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>history.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Which service do you mean to enter?" the Dean asked him one day. "In a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>week's time you will be leaving the University. What are you going to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky was silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What profession have you selected?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky almost answered that he meant to be an artist, but he remembered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in time the reception that this proposition had received from his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guardian and his aunt. "I shall write verses," he answered in a low tone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But that is not a profession. You may write verses and yet...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Stories too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Naturally, you can write stories as well. You have talent and means to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>develop it. But what profession--profession, I asked."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For the moment I shall enter the Guards, later on the Civil Service--I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mean to be a barrister, a governor...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Dean smiled. "You begin by being an ensign, that is comprehensible.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You and Leonid Koslov are exceptions; every other man has made his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>decision."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Koslov was asked his intentions he replied that he would like to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a schoolmaster somewhere in the interior, and from this intention he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>refused to be turned aside.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky moved among the golden youth of St. Petersburg society, first as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young officer, then as bureaucrat, fulfilled his duties in devotion to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the beauty of many an Armide, suffering to some degree, and gaining some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>experience in the process. After a time his dreams and his artistic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consciousness revived. He seemed to see the Volga flowing between its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>steep banks, the shady garden, and the wooded precipice. He abandoned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Civil Service in its turn to enter the Academy of Arts. His</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>education would never be finished, but he was determined to be a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>creative artist. His aunt scolded him by letter for having left the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Guards; his guardian advised him to seek a position in the Senate, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sent him letters of recommendation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But Raisky did not enter the Senate, but indolently pursued his artistic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>studies, read a great deal, wrote poems and prose, danced, went into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>society and to the theatre, indulged in wild dissipation, and at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>same time did some musical composition, and drew a portrait of a lady.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He would spend one week in dissipation and the next in diligent study at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Academy. Life knocked at the door and tore him from his artist's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dreams to a dissolute existence of alternating pleasure and boredom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The universal summer exodus from the capital had driven him abroad. But</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one day when he came home he found two letters awaiting him, one from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna, the other from his comrade at the University, Leonid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Koslov, who had been installed in Raisky's native place as a master in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Gymnasium.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>During all these years his aunt had often written to him, and sent him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>statements of accounts. His answers were short but affectionate; the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accounts he tore up without having even looked at them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it not a sin," she wrote, "to forget an old woman like me, when I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all the family you have? But in these days it seems that old people have,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the judgment of youth, become superfluous. But I have not even</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leisure to die; I have two grown-up nieces, and until their future is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>settled to my satisfaction, I shall pray God to spare my life--and then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>His will be done. I do not complain that you forget me. But if I were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not here my little girls, your sisters, would be alone. You are their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>next of kin and their natural protector. Think, too, of the estate. I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old, and can no longer be your bailiff. To whom do you intend to entrust</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the estate? The place will be ruined and the estate dissipated. It</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breaks my heart to think that your family silver, bronzes, pictures,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>diamonds, lace, china and glass will come into the hands of the servants,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or the Jews, or the usurers. So long as your Grandmother lives, you may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be sure that not a thread goes astray, but after that I can give no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guarantee. And my two nieces, what is to become of them? Vera is a good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sensible, but retiring girl, and does not concern herself with domestic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>matters at all. Marfinka will be a splendid manager, but she is still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young; although she ought to have been married before now, she is still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>such a child in her ideas, thank God! She will mature with experience,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and meantime I shelter her. She appreciates this and does nothing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>against her Grandmother's will, for which may God reward her. In the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house she is a great help, but I do not let her do anything on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>estate; that is no work for a young girl.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not defer your coming, but gladden your Grandmother's heart. She is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>devoted to you, not merely because of the relationship, but from her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart. You were conscious of the sympathy between us when you were a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>child. I don't know what you are in manhood, but you were then a good</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nephew. Come, if only to see your sisters, and perhaps happiness will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reward your coming. If God grants me the joy of seeing you married and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>laying the estate in your hands I shall die happy. Marry, Borushka; you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are long since of an age to do so. Then my little girls will still have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a home. So long as you remain unmarried they cannot live in your house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marry, please your Grandmother, and God will not forsake you. I wait</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your coming; let me know when to expect you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tiet Nikonich desires to be remembered to you. He has aged, but is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>still hale and hearty, he has the same smile, still talks well and has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>such pleasant manners that none of the young dandies can hold a candle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to him. Bring him, please, a vest and hose of Samian leather; it is worn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now, I hear, as a specific against rheumatism. It will be a surprise for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him. I enclose the account for the last two years. Accept my blessing."</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In a _kibitka_ covered with bast, drawn by three lean and sleepy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nags, Raisky drove slowly to his estate. It was not without agitation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that he saw the smoke curling up from the chimneys of his own roof, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fresh, delicate green of the birches and the limes which overshadowed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this place of refuge, the gables of the old house and the pale line of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Volga now gleaming between the trees and now hidden from view. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>approached nearer and nearer; now he could see the shimmer of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flowers in the garden, the avenues of lime and acacia became visible,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the old elm emerged, and there, more to the left, lay the orchard. There</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were dogs in the yard, cats sunning themselves, on the roof of the new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house flocked the pigeon and the swallows flitted around the eaves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Behind the house, on the side towards the village, linen lay out to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bleach. One woman was rolling a cask, the coachman was chopping wood, a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>peasant got into the _telega_ and gathered up the reins--Boris saw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only unfamiliar faces. But Yakob was there and looked sleepily round.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>One familiar face, but how aged!</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky observed the scene intently. He alighted from the _kibitka_,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and walked along the fence which divided house, yard, garden and park</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from the road, feasting his eyes on the well-remembered prospect, when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suddenly his eye was caught by an unexpected apparition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On the verandah, which led down to the garden and was decorated by lemon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and pomegranate trees in tubs, and with cactus and aloe and flowering</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>plants, stood a young girl of about twenty, scattering millet from two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>plates held by a barefooted child of twelve. At her feet were assembled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hens, turkeys, ducks, pigeons, sparrows and daws. She called to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>birds to come to breakfast, and cocks, hens and pigeons fell to, looking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>round every moment as if they feared treason, and then again falling to.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>As the morning sun shed a fierce light on the busy group of birds and on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the young girl herself, Raisky saw her large, dark grey eyes, her round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>healthy cheeks, her narrow white teeth, her long light-brown tresses</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wound twice round her head, and the strong young breasts rising and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sinking underneath her white blouse. Her white, slightly tanned neck was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>innocent of collar or scarf. A hasty movement loosened one plait of hair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over her head and back, but she took no notice, but continued to scatter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the corn, taking care that all received their share and that sparrows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and daws did not obtrude too much, and looking as fresh and happy as the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning itself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Didn't you see the goose?" she asked the little girl in a loud clear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>voice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No," answered the child, "it is the cat's fault. Afimua says it will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>die."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I shall look after it myself. Afimua has no pity."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Motionless, Raisky watched the scene without his presence being</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suspected. This must be his cousin, and how charming! But which one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Veroshka or Marfinka? Without waiting for the _kibitka_ to turn in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through the gate, he ran forward, and stood before the young girl.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Cousin," he cried, extending his arms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In a moment both girls had vanished as if by magic, the sparrows were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away on the roof, and the pigeons in flight. The servants in the yard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stopped their work. Raisky looked in amazement on the emptiness and at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the corn scattered at his feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then he heard in the house bustle, murmurs, movement, the clatter of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>keys, and his aunt's voice, "Where is he?" Her face lighted up when she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saw Raisky and she opened her arms, to press him to her breast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She had aged, but in so even, so healthy a fashion, that there were no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unwholesome patches, no deep hanging pockets about the eyes and mouth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no sadness or gloom in her eyes. Life had not conquered her; she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conquered life, and only slowly laid down her weapons in the combat. Her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>voice was not so clear as of old, and she leaned on a stick, but she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made no complaint. She still wore no cap on her short hair. Health and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kindliness shone from her eyes, and not only from her eyes, from her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole figure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Borushka, my friend!" Three times she embraced him. Tears stood in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes. In her embrace, her voice, in the sudden grip of joy, there was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tenderness, affection, and ardour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He felt that he was almost a criminal, that he had been playing with his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>emotions and seeking forbidden fruit, wandering homelessly in the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>while Nature himself had been preparing for him a nest where sympathy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and happiness awaited him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marfinka, where are you, come here," cried her grandmother. "She was so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terrified when she saw you, and terrified me too. Let me look at you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Borushka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She led him to the light and looked at him long and earnestly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How ill you look," she said. "But no, you are sunburnt. The moustache</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suits you, why do you grow a beard? Shave it off, Borushka, I can't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>endure it. Ah! grey hairs here and there already. You are beginning to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>age too soon."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It's not with age, Granny."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why then? Are you in good health?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I'm well enough. Let us talk of something else. You, thank God, are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>always the same."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You don't alter a bit, are still as beautiful as ever. I never saw an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old lady whose age adorned her so."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thanks for the compliment, my child. It would be better for you to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spend your admiration on your sisters. I will whisper the truth to you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Two such beauties you will not find in the town, especially the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is my other sister?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"On a visit to the pope's wife on the other side of the Volga. It is a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pity. The pope's wife has been ill and sent for her, of course just now.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A messenger shall go."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No! No! Why should anyone be disturbed on my account?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you have come on your Grandmother so suddenly. We waited, waited,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in vain. The peasants sat up for you at night, I have just sent Egorka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on to the highway to look for you and Savili into the town. Now you must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have your breakfast. Why is it so long in coming? The master has come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and there is nothing ready, just as if the house was nothing better than</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a station. Serve what is ready."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I need nothing, Granny. I am stuffed with food. At one station I drank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tea, milk at another, and at the third there was a wedding, and I was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>treated to wine, meat and gingerbread."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are on your way home to your Grandmother, and are not ashamed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eat and drink all sorts of things. Gingerbread in the morning! Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ought to have been there; she loves weddings and gingerbread. Come in.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, don't be so shy. She is ashamed because you caught her in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning gown. Come here, darling; he is your brother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tea and coffee appeared, and finally breakfast. However much he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>protested Raisky had to eat, for otherwise his aunt's morning would have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been spoiled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marfinka, come here and entertain us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After about five minutes the door opened slowly and quietly, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka entered, blushing with confusion and with downcast eyes. At her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heels followed Vassilissa with a tea-tray full of sweets, preserves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cakes, etc. Marfinka stood still, betraying in her confusion a certain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>curiosity. She wore lace at her neck and wrists; her hair was plaited</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>firmly around her head and the waist of her barХge dress encircled by a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blue ribbon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky threw down his napkin, and jumped up, to stand before her in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>admiration. "How lovely," he cried. "This is my little sister, Marfa</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna. And is the goose still alive?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka became still more embarrassed, returned his greeting awkwardly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and retired to a corner.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have both gone mad," interrupted their aunt. "Is that the way to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>greet one another?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marfa Vassilievna," said Raisky, as he sought to kiss Marfinka's hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vassilievna!" cried Tatiana Markovna. "Don't you love her any more?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, not Marfa Vassilievna! You will be addressing me as Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna next! Kiss one another. Are you not brother and sister?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I won't, Grandmama. He is teasing me about the goose. It is not polite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to spy on people," she said severely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Everybody laughed. Raisky kissed her on both cheeks, embraced her, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>overcame her confusion. She kissed him in return, and her shyness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vanished.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you remember, Marfinka, how we used to run about and draw, and how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you cried?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No ... but yes. I do remember as if in a dream."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should she remember, when she was only five?" interrupted her aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But I do, Grandmama, as in a dream."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had hardly captured his old memories when Marfinka disappeared.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Soon she returned with sketch books, drawings and toys, and sitting down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by Raisky in friendly fashion began, "Granny says that I don't remember.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I remember how you used to draw, and how I sat on your knee. Granny has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all your drawings, portraits and sketch books. She has kept them all in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the dark room where the silver, the diamonds and the lace are. She got</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them out, and gave them to me a little time ago, when she heard you were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coming. Here is my portrait. How funny I looked! And here is Veroshka,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Granny, and Vassilissa. Do you remember how you held me, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Veroshka sat on your shoulder, and you carried us over the water?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you remember that too?" asked her aunt. "Boastful child! Veroshka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said the other day...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"This is how I draw now," said Marfinka, handing him a drawing of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bunch of flowers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Splendid, little sister! Is it done from nature?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, from nature. I can make wax-flowers, too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And do you play or sing?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I play the piano."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And does Veroshka draw and play?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka shook her head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does she like needlework? No? Then is she fond of reading?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, she reads a great deal. But she does not tell us what she reads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nor show us the book, nor even say where she got it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She hides herself from everybody, does my strange child," sighed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna. "God only knows what will become of her. Now, Marfinka,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>don't waste your brother's time any longer with your chatter about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trifles. We will talk about serious matters, about the estate."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The old lady had worn a serious expression while she watched Boris as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>talked to Marfinka. She recognised his mother's features, but the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>changes in his face did not escape her--the indications of vanishing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>youth, the premature furrows; and she was baffled by the original</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expression of his eyes. Formerly she had always been able to read his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face, but now there was much inscribed on it that was undecipherable for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her. Yet his temperament was open and affectionate and his words frankly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>interpreted his thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now his aunt stood before him wearing a most business-like expression;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in her hand were accounts and a ledger.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you not weary with your journey?" she said. "You are yawning and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>perhaps you would like a little sleep. Business can wait till</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-morrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I slept a good deal on the journey. But you are giving yourself useless</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trouble, Grandmother, for I am not going to look at your accounts."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What? You have surely come to take over the estate and to ask for an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>account of my stewardship. The accounts and statements that I sent you--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have never even read, Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You haven't read them. I have sent you precise information about your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>income and you don't even know how your money is spent."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And I don't want to know," answered Raisky, looking out of the window</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away towards the banks of the Volga.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Imagine, Marfinka," he said, "I remember a verse I learnt as a child--</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'Oh Volga, proudest of rivers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Stem thy hurrying flood;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Oh Volga, hearken, hearken,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>To the ringing song of the poet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The unknown, whose life thou hast spared.'"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't be vexed with me, Borushka," cried Tatiana Markovna, "but I think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you are mad. What have you done with the papers I sent you? Have you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brought them?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where are they?" she continued, as he shook his head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny, I tore up all the accounts, and I swear I will do the same with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these if you worry me with them."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He seized the paper, but she snatched them away, exclaiming, "You dare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to tear up my accounts."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He laughed, suddenly embraced her, and kissed her lips as he had done</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when he was a child. She shook herself free and wiped her mouth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I toil till midnight, adding up and writing down every kopek, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tears up my work. That is why you never wrote about money matters, gave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>any orders, made any preparations, or did anything of the kind. Did you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never think of your estate?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not at all, Granny. I forgot all about it. If I thought at all I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought of these rooms in which lives the only woman who loves me and is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loved by me, you alone in the whole world. And now," he said, turning to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, "I want to win my sisters too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His aunt took off her spectacles and gazed at him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In all my days I have never seen anything like it," she said. "Here the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only person with no roots like that is Markushka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What sort of person is this Markushka. Leonti Koslov writes about him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>How is Leonti, Granny? I must look him up."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should he be? He crouches in one spot with a book, and his wife in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another. But he does not even see what goes on under his nose, and can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>any good come from his friendship with this Markushka. Only the other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>day your friend came here to complain that that Markushka was destroying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books from your library. You know, don't you, that the library from the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old house has been installed in Koslov's house?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky hummed an air from _"Il Barbiere."_</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are an extraordinary man," cried his aunt angrily. "Why did you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come at all? Do talk sensibly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I came to see you, Granny, to live here for a little while, to breathe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>freely, to look out over the Volga, to write, to draw...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But the estate? If you are not tired we will drive out into the field,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to look at the sowing of the winter-corn."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Later on, Granny."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will you take over the management of the estate?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Granny, I will not."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who then is to look after it? I am old and can no longer do all the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>work. Do you wish me to put the estate into strange hands?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Farm it yourself, Granny, so long as you take any pleasure in it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And if I die?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then leave everything as it is."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna looked at the portrait of Raisky's mother, for a long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time she looked at the languishing eyes, the melancholy smile.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes," she whispered. "I honour the memory of the departed, but hers is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the fault. She kept you by her side, talked to you, played the piano,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>read out of books and wept as she did so. And this is the result.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Singing and painting. Now tell me, Borushka," she went on in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ordinary tone, "what is to become of the house, of the linen, the silver,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the diamonds? Shall you order them to be given to the peasants?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do I possess diamonds and silver?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How often have I told you so? From your mother you have inherited all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these things; what is to be done with them. I will show you the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inventory of them."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't do that, for Heaven's sake. I can believe they are mine. And so I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>can dispose of them as I please?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Of course; you are the proprietor. We live here as your guests, though</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>we do not eat your bread. See here are my receipts and expenditure," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said, thrusting towards another big ledger which he waved away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But I believe all you say, Granny," he said. "Send for a clerk and tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him to make out a deed, by which I give the house, the land, and all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that belongs to it to my dear cousins, Veroshka and Marfinka, as dowry."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The old lady wrinkled her brow, and waited impatiently till he should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>finish speaking. "So long as you live, dear Granny," he continued, "the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>estate naturally remains under your control; the peasants must have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their freedom...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Never," interrupted his aunt, "Veroshka and Marfinka are not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beggars--each of them has her fifty thousand roubles--and after my death</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>three times that sum, perhaps more. All I have is for my little girls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and, thank God, I am not a pauper. I have a corner of my own, a bit of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>land, and a roof to cover them. One would think you were a millionaire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You make gifts; you will have this, and you won't have that. Here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka! where have you hidden yourself?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Directly!" cried Marfinka's clear voice from a neighbouring room. Happy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gay, smiling and frank, she fluttered into the room, looked hesitatingly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>first at Raisky, then at her aunt, who was nearly beside herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your cousin, Marfinka, is pleased to present you with a house, silver,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and lace. You are, he thinks, a beggared, dowerless girl. Make a curtsey,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thank your benefactor, kiss his hand--Well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, who did not know what to say, squeezed herself flat against</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the stove and looked at her two relatives. Her aunt pushed papers and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books on one side, crossed her hands over her breast, and looked out of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the window, while Raisky sat down beside Marfinka, and took her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Would you like to go away from here, Marfinka, into a strange house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>perhaps in an altogether different district?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God forbid! How could such a thing happen. Who ever imagined such</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nonsense?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny," laughed Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Happily "Granny" had not heard the words. Marfinka was embarrassed, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked out of the window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here I have everything I want, the lovely flowers in the garden, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>birds. Who would look after the birds? I will never go away from here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But Granny wants to go and take you with her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny! Where? Why?" she asked her aunt in her caressing, coaxing way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't tease me," said Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marfinka, you don't want to leave home?" asked Boris.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not for anything in the world. How could such a thing be?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What would Veroshka say about it?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She would never be separated from the old house."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She loves the old house?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes. She is only happy when she is here. If she were taken away from it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she would die. We both should."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That matter is settled then, little sister. You two, Veroshka and you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will accept the gift from me, won't you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will if Veroshka agrees."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Agreed, dear sister. You are not so proud as Granny," he said, as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kissed her forehead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is agreed?" suddenly grumbled Tatiana Markovna. "You have accepted?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Who told you you might accept? Grandmother will never permit you to live</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at a stranger's expense. Be so kind, Boris Pavlovich, as to take over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books, accounts, inventories and sales. I am not your paid servant." She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pushed papers and books towards him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny! My name is Tatiana Markovna Berezhkov." She stood up, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opened the door into the servants' room. "Send Savili here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, a peasant of almost forty-five years of age</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opened the door with a casual greeting. He was strongly-built, big boned,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and was robust, without being fat. His eyes with their overhanging brows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and wide heavy lids, wasted no idle glances; he neither spoke an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unnecessary word, nor made a superfluous gesture.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The proprietor is here," said Tatiana Markovna, indicating Raisky. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must now make your reports to him. He intends to administer the estate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Savili looked askance at Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At your orders," he said stiffly, slowly raising his eyes. "What orders</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are you pleased to give?" he asked, lowering his eyes again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky thought for a moment before he replied:</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you know an official who could draw up a document for the transfer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the estate?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Gavril Ivanov Meshetshnikov draws up the papers we require," he said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Send for him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As Savili bowed, and slowly retired, Raisky followed him with his eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"An anxious rascal," was his comment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should he be other than anxious," said his aunt, "when he is tied</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to a wife like Marina Antipovna? Do you remember Antip? Well, she is his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>daughter. But for his marriage he is a treasure. He does my important</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>business, sells the corn, and collects the money. He is honest and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>practical, but fate deals her blows where she will, and every man must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bear his own burden. But what idea have you in your head now? Are you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beside yourself?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Something must be done. I am going away, and you will not administer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the estate, so some arrangement must be made."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And is that your reason for going? I thought you were now going to take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over the management of your estate. You have done enough gadding about.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Why not marry and settle here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She was visibly struggling with herself. It had never entered her head</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to give up the administration; she would not have known what to do with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself. Her idea had been to alarm Raisky, and he was taking her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seriously.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is to be done?" she said. "I will see after the estate as long as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I have the strength to do so. How else should you live, you strange</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>creature?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I receive two thousand roubles from my other estate, and that is a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sufficient income. I want to work, to draw, to write, to travel for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>little; and for that purpose I might mortgage or sell the other estate."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God bless you, Borushka, what next? Are you so near beggary? You talk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of drawing, writing, alienating your land; next it will be giving</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lessons or school teaching. Instead of arriving with four horses and a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>travelling carriage you sneak in, without a servant, in a miserable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>_kibitka_, you, a Raisky. Look at the old house, at the portraits</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of your ancestors, and take shame to yourself. Shame, Borushka! How</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>splendid it would have been if you had come epauletted like Sergei</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivanovich, and had married a wife with a dowry of three thousand souls."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky burst out laughing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why laugh? I am speaking seriously when I tell you what a joy it would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have been for your Grandmother. Then you would have wanted the lace and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the silver, and not be flinging it away."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But as I am not marrying, I don't need these things. Therefore it is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>settled that Veroshka and Marfinka shall have them."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your decision is final?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is final. And it is further settled that if you do not like this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arrangement, everything passes into the hands of strangers. You have my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>word for it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your word for it," cried his aunt. "You are a lost man. Where have you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lived, and what have you done. Tell me, for Heaven's sake, what your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>purpose in life is, and what you really are?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What I am, Grandmother? The unhappiest of men!" He leaned his head back</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the cushion as he spoke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Never say such a thing," she interrupted. "Fate hears and exacts the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>penalty, and you will one day be unhappy. Either be content or feign</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>content."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked anxiously round, as if Fate were already standing at her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shoulder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky rose from the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let us be reconciled," he said. "Agree to keep this little corner of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>God's earth under your protection."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is an estate, not a 'corner.'"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Resign yourself to my gift of this old stuff to the dear girls. A</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lonely man like me has no use for it, but they will be mistresses of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house. If you don't agree, I will present it to the school...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The school-children! Those rascals who steal our apples, shall not have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Come to the point, Granny! You don't really want to leave this nest in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your old age."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We'll see, we'll see. Give them the lace on their wedding-day. I can do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing with you; talk to Tiet Nikonich who is coming to dinner." And</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she wondered what would come of such strangeness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky took his cap to go out, and Marfinka went with him. She showed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him the park, her own garden, the vegetable and flower gardens, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arbours. When they came to the precipice she looked anxiously over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>edge, and drew back with a shudder. Raisky looked down on the Volga,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which was in flood, and had overflowed into the meadows. In the distance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were ships which appeared to be motionless, and above hung heaped banks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of cloud. Marfinka drew closer to Raisky, and looked down indifferently</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the familiar picture.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Come down!" he said suddenly, and seized her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, I am afraid," she answered trembling, and drew back.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I won't let you fall. Do you think I can't take care of you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not at all, but I am afraid. Veroshka has no fear, but goes down alone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>even in the dusk. Although a murderer lies buried there, she is not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afraid."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Try, shut your eyes, and give me your hand. You will see how carefully</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I take you down."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka half closed her eyes, but she had hardly taken his hand and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made one step, when she found herself standing on the edge of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice. Shuddering she withdrew her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I would not go down for anything in the world," she cried as she ran</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back. "Where are you going to!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>No answer reached her. She approached the edge and looked timidly over.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She saw how the bushes were bent noisily aside, as Raisky sprang down,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>step by step. How horrible! she thought as she returned to the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went nearly all round the town, and when he climbed the cliffs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>once more, he was on the extreme boundary of his estate. A steep path</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>led down to the suburbs, and the town lay before him as in the palm of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hand. Stirred with the passion aroused by his memories of childhood, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked at the rows of houses, cottages and huts. It was not a town, but,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like other towns, a cemetery. Going from street to street, Raisky saw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through the windows, how in one house the family sat at dinner, and in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another the amovar had already been brought in. In the empty streets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>every conversation could be heard a _verst_ away; voices and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>footsteps re-echoed on the wooden pavement. It seemed to Raisky a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>picture of dreamy peace, the tranquillity of the grave. What a frame for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a novel, if only he knew what to put in the novel. The houses fell into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their places in the picture that filled his mind, he drew in the faces</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the towns-people, grouped the servants with his aunt, the whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>composition centring in Marfinka. The figures stood sharply outlined in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his mind; they lived and breathed. If the image of passion should float</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over this motionless sleeping little world, the picture would glow with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the enchanting colour of life. Where was he to find the passion, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>colour?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Passion!" he repeated to himself. If her burning fire could but be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>poured out upon him, and engulf the artist in her destroying waves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As he moved forward he remembered that his stroll had an aim. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wondered how Leonid Koslov was, whether he had changed, or whether he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had remained what he had been before, a child for all his learning. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>too was a good subject for an artist. Raisky thought of Leonti's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beautiful wife, whose acquaintance he had made during his student days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in Moscow, when she was a young girl. She used to call Leonti her fiancИ,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without any denial on his part, and five years after he had left the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>University he made the journey to Moscow, and married her. He loved his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wife as a man loves air and warmth; absorbed in the life and art of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ancients, his lover's eyes saw in her the antique ideal of beauty. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lines of her neck and bosom charmed him, and her head recalled to him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Roman heads seen on bas-reliefs and cameos.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti did not recognise Raisky, when his friend suddenly entered his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>study.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have not the honour," he began.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But when Boris Pavlovich opened his lips he embraced him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wife! Ulinka!" he cried into the garden. "Come quickly, and see who has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come to see us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She came hastily, and kissed Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a man you have grown, and how much more handsome you are!" she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said, her eyes flashing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her eyes, her mien, her whole figure betrayed audacity. Just over thirty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>years old, she gave the impression of a splendidly developed specimen of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blooming womanhood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you forgotten me?" she asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should he forget you?" broke in Leonti. "But Ulinka is right. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have altered, and are hardly recognisable with your beard. How delighted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your Aunt must have been to see you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah! his Aunt!" remarked Juliana Andreevna in a tone of displeasure. "I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>don't like her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She is despotic and censorious."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, she is a despot," answered Raisky. "That comes from intercourse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with serfs. Old customs!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"According to Tatiana Markovna," continued Juliana Andreevna, "everybody</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should stay on one spot, turn his head neither to right nor left, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never exchange a word with his neighbours. She is a past mistress in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fault-finding; nevertheless she and Tiet Nikonich are inseparable, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spends his days and nights with her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky laughed and said, "She is a saint nevertheless, whatever you may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>find to say about her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A saint perhaps, but nothing is right for her. Her world is in her two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nieces, and who knows how they will turn out? Marfinka plays with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>canaries and her flowers, and the other sits in the corner like the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>family ghost, and not a word can be got from her. We shall see what will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>become of her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Veroshka? I haven't seen her yet. She is away on a visit on the other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>side of the Volga."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And who knows what her business is there?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I love my Aunt as if she were my Mother," said Raisky emphatically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She is wise, honourable, just! She has strength and individuality, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there is nothing commonplace about her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will believe everything she says?" asked Juliana Andreevna, drawing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him away to the window, while Leonti collected the scattered papers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>laid them in cupboards and put the books on the shelves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, everything," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't believe her. I know she will tell you all sorts of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nonsense--about Monsieur Charles."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is he?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A Frenchman, a teacher, and a colleague of my husband's. They sit there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reading till all hours. How can I help it? Yet God knows what they make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out of it in the town, as if I.... Don't believe it," she went on, as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saw Raisky was silent. "It is idle talk, there is nothing," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>concluded, with a false smile intended to be allowing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What business is it of mine?" returned Raisky, turning away from her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Shall we go into the garden?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, we will have dinner outside," said Leonti. "Serve what there is,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ulinka. Come, Boris, now we can talk." Then as an idea struck him, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>added, "What shall you have to say to me about the library?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"About what library? You wrote to me about it, but I did not understand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what you were talking about. I think you said some person called Mark,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had been tearing the books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You cannot imagine, Boris, how vexed I was about it," he said as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>took down some books with torn backs from the shelves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky pushed the books away. "What does it matter to me?" he said. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are like my grandmother; she bothers me about accounts, you about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But Boris, I don't know what accounts she bothered you about, but these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books are your most precious possession. Look!" he said, pointing with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pride to the rows of books which filled the study to the ceiling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Only on this shelf nearly everything is ruined by that accursed Mark!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The other books are all right. See, I drew up a catalogue, which took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a whole year to do," and he pointed self-consciously to a thick bound</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>volume of manuscript. "I wrote it all with my own hand," he continued.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Sit down, Boris, and read out the names. I will get on the ladder, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>show you the books; they are arranged according to their numbers."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What an idea!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Or better wait till after dinner; we shall not be able to finish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Listen, should you like to have a library like that?" asked Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I!--a library like that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sunshine blazed from Leonti's eyes, he smiled so broadly that even the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hair on his brow stirred with the dislocation caused. "A library like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that?" He shook his head. "You must be mad."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tell me, do you love me as you used to do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do you ask? Of course."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then the books shall be yours for good and all, under one condition."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I--take these books!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti looked now at the books, now at Raisky, then made a gesture of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>refusal, and sighed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not laugh at me, Boris! Don't tempt me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not joking."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here Juliana Andreevna, who had heard the last words, chimed in with,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Take what is given you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She is always like that," sighed Leonti. "On feast days the tradesmen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come with presents, and on the eve of the examinations the parents. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>send them away, but my wife receives them at the side door. She looks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like Lucretia, but she has a sweet tooth, a dainty one."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky laughed, but Juliana Andreevna was annoyed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go to your Lucretia," she said indifferently. "He compares me with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everybody. One day I am Cleopatra, then Lavinia, then Cornelia. Better</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>take the books when they are offered you. Boris Pavlovich will give them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't take it on yourself to ask him for gifts," commanded Leonti. "And</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what can we give him? Shall I hand you over to him, for instance?" he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>added as he embraced her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Splendid! Take me, Boris Pavlovich," she cried, throwing a sparkling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glance at him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you don't take the books, Leonti," said Raisky, "I will make them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over to the Gymnasium. Give me the catalogue, and I'll send it to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Director to-morrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He put his hand out for the catalogue, of which Leonti kept a tight hold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The Gymnasium shall never get one of them," he cried. "You don't know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Director, who cares for books just about as much as I do for perfume</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and pomade. They will be destroyed, torn, and worse handled than by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then take them."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To give away such treasures all in a minute. It would be comprehensible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if you were selling them to responsible hands. I have never wanted so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>much to be rich. I would give five thousand. I cannot accept, I cannot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You are a spendthrift, or rather a blind, ignorant child--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Many thanks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I didn't mean that," cried Leonti in confusion. "You are an artist; you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>need pictures, statues, music; and books are nothing to you. Besides,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you don't know what treasures you possess; after dinner I will show</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, in the afternoon, instead of drinking coffee, you will go over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the books to the Gymnasium for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait, Boris, what was the condition on which you would give me the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books. Will you take instalments from my salary for them? I would sell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all I have, pledge myself and my wife."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, thank you," broke in Juliana Andreevna, "I can pledge or sell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>myself if I want to."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti and Raisky looked at one another.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She does not think before she speaks," said Leonti. "But tell me what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the condition is."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That you never mention these books to me again, even if Mark tears them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to pieces."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you mean I am not to let him have access to them?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is not likely to ask you," put in Juliana Andreevna. "As if that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>monster cared for what you may say."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How Ulinka loves me," said Leonti to Raisky. "Would that every woman</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loved her husband like that."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He embraced her. She dropped her eyes, and the smile died from her face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But for her you would not see a single button on my clothes," continued</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti. "I eat and sleep comfortably, and our household goes on evenly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and placidly. However small my means are she knows how to make them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>provide for everything." She raised her eyes, and looked at them, for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the last statement was true. "It's a pity," continued Leonti, "that she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>does not care about books. She can chatter French fast enough, but if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you give her a book, she does not understand half of it. She still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>writes Russian incorrectly. If she sees Greek characters, she says they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would make a good pattern for cotton printing, and sets the book upside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>down. And she cannot even read a Latin title."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That will do. Not another word about the books. Only on that condition,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I don't send them to the Gymnasium. Now let us sit down to table, or I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shall go to my Grandmother's, for I am famished."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you intend to spend your whole life like this?" asked Raisky as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was sitting after dinner alone with Leonti in the study.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, what more do I need?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you no desires, does nothing call you away from this place, have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you no longings for freedom and space, and don't you feel cramped in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this narrow frame of hedge, church spire and house, under your very</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nose?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have I so little to look at under my nose?" asked Leonti, pointing to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the books. "I have books, pupils, and in addition a wife and peace of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart, isn't that enough?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are books life? This old trash has a great deal to answer for. Men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strive forwards, seek to improve themselves, to cleanse their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conceptions, to drive away the mist, to meet the problems of society by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>justice, civilisation, orderly administration, while you instead of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking at life, study books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is not to be found in books is not to be found in life either, or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if there is anything it is of no importance," said Leonti firmly. "The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole programme of public and private life lies behind us; we can find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an example for everything."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are still the same old student, Leonti, always worrying about what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>has been experienced in the past, and never thinking of what you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself are."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What I am! I am a teacher of the classics. I am as deeply concerned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the life of the past, as you with ideals and figures. You are an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>artist. Why should you wonder that certain figures are dear to me? Since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when have artists ceased to draw water from the wells of the ancients?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, an artist," said Raisky, with a sigh. He pointed to his head and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breast. "Here are figures, notes, forms, enthusiasm, the creative</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passion, and as yet I have done almost nothing."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What restrains you? You are now painting, you wrote me, a great picture,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which you mean to exhibit."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The devil take the great pictures. I shall hardly be able to devote my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole energy to painting now. One must put one's whole being into a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>great picture, and then to give effect to one hundredth part of what one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>has put in a representation of a fleeting, irrecoverable impression.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sometimes I paint portraits...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What art are you following now?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is but one Art that can satisfy the artist of to-day, the art of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>words, of poetry, which is limitless in its possibilities."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You write verses then?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Verses are children's food. In verse you celebrate a love affair, a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>festival, flowers, a nightingale."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And satire. Remember the use made of it by the Romans."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>With these words he would have gone to the bookshelf, but Raisky held</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him back. "You may," he said, "be able now and then to hit a diseased</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spot with satire. Satire is a rod, whose stroke stings but has no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>further consequences; but she does not show you figures brimming with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>life, she does not reveal the depths of life with its secret mainsprings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of action, she holds no mirror before your eyes. It is only the novel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that comprehends and mirrors the life of man."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So you are writing a novel? On what subject?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have not yet quite decided."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't at all events describe this pettifogging, miserable existence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which stares us in the face without the medium of art. Our contemporary</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>literature squeezes every worm, every peasant-girl, and I don't know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what else, into the novel. Choose a historical subject, worthy of your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vivacious imagination and your clean-cut style. Do you remember how you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>used to write of old Russia? Now it is the fashion to choose material</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from the ant-heap, the talking shop of everyday life. This is to be the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stuff of which literature is made. Bah! it is the merest journalism."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There we are again on the old controversy. If you once mount that horse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there will be no calling you back. Let us leave this question for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>moment, and go back to my question. Are you satisfied to spend your life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here, as you are now doing, with no desires for anything further?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti looked at him in astonishment, with wide opened eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You do nothing for your generation," Raisky went on, "but creep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>backwards like a crab. Why are you for ever talking of the Greeks and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Romans? Their work is done, and ours is to bring life into these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cemeteries, to shake the slumbering ghosts out of their twilight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dreams."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And how is the task to be begun?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I mean to draw a picture of this existence, to reflect it as in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mirror. And you...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I too accomplish something. I have prepared several boys for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>University," remarked Leonti with hesitation, for he was not sure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whether this was meritorious or not. "You imagine that I go into my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>class, then home, and forget about everything. That is not the case.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Young people gather round me, attach themselves to me, and I show them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drawings of old buildings, utensils, make sketches and give explanations,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as I once did for you. What I know myself I communicate to others,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>explain the ancient ideals of virtue, expound classical life, just as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>our own classics are explained. Is that no longer essential?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Certainly it has its advantage. But it has nothing to do with real life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>One cannot live like that to-day. So much has disappeared, so many</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things have arisen that the Greeks and Romans never knew. But we need</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>models from contemporary life, we must educate ourselves and others to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be men. That is our task."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, I do not take that upon my shoulders; it is sufficient for one to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>take the models of ancient virtue from books. I myself live for and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through myself. You see I live quietly and modestly, eat my vermicelli</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>soup...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Life for and through yourself is not life at all, it is a passive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>condition, and man is a fighting animal."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have already told you that I do my duty and do not interfere in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anybody else's business; and no one interferes with mine."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Life's arm is long, and will not spare even you. And how will you meet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her blows--unprepared."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What has Life to do with a humble man like me? I shall pass unnoticed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I have books, although they are not mine," he said glancing hesitatingly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at Raisky, "but you give me free use of them. My needs are small, I feel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no boredom. I have a wife who loves me...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky looked away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And," he added in a whisper, "I love her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was plain that as his mind nourished itself on the books, so his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart had found a warm refuge; he himself did not even know what bound</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him to life and books, and did not guess that he might keep his books</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and lose his life, and that his life would be maimed if his "Roman head"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was stolen from him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Happy child, thought Raisky. In his learned sleep he does not notice the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>darkness that is hidden in that dear Roman head, nor how empty the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman's heart is. He is helpless as far as she is concerned, and will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never convince her of the virtues of the ancient ideals.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The sun was setting when Raisky returned home, and was received at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>door by Marfinka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where did you get lost, Cousin?" she asked him. "Grandmother is very</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>angry, and is grumbling...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was with Leonti," returned Raisky indifferently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I thought so, and told Grandmother so, but she won't listen and will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly speak even to Tiet Nikonich. He is with her now and Paulina</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Karpovna too. Go to Grandmother, and it will be all right. Are you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afraid. Does your heart beat fast?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had to laugh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She is very angry. We had prepared so many dishes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We will eat them up for supper."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will you? Grandmother, Grandmother," she cried happily, "Cousin has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come and wants his supper."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His aunt sat severely there, and did not look up when Raisky entered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tiet Nikonich embraced him. He received an elegant bow from Paulina</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Karpovna, an elaborately got-up person of forty-five in a low cut muslin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gown, with a fine lace handkerchief and a fan, which she kept constantly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in motion although there was no heat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a man you have grown! I should hardly have known you," said Tiet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikonich, beaming with kindness and pleasure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He has grown very, very handsome," said Paulina Karpovna Kritzki.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have not altered, Tiet Nikonich," remarked Raisky. "You have hardly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aged at all, and are as gay, as fresh, as kind and amiable...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank God! there is nothing worse than rheumatism the matter with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and my digestion is no longer quite as good as it was. That is age, age.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But how glad I am that you, our guest, have arrived in such good spirits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna was anxious about you. You will be staying here for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some time?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Of course you will spend the summer with us," said Paulina Karpovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here is nature, and fine air, and so many people are interested in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked at her askance, and said nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you remember me?" she asked. Boris's aunt noticed with displeasure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that Paulina Karpovna was ogling her nephew.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, I must confess I forgot."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, impressions are quickly forgotten in the capital," she said in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a languishing tone. She looked him up and down and then added, "What an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>admirable travelling suit."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That reminds me I am still in my travelling clothes. Egor must be sent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for and must take my clothes and linen out of the trunk. For you, Granny,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and for you, my dear sisters, I have brought some small things for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remembrance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka grew crimson with pleasure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny, where are you going to put me up?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The house belongs to you. Where you will," she returned coldly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't be angry, Granny," he laughed. "It won't happen twice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You may laugh, you may laugh, Boris Pavlovich. Here, in the presence of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>our guests, I tell you you have behaved badly. You have hardly put your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nose inside the house, and straightway vanish. That is an insult to your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Surely, Granny, we shall be together every day. I have been visiting an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old friend, and we forgot ourselves in talking."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Cousin Boris did not do it on purpose, Granny," said Marfinka. "Leonti</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivanovich is so good."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Please be silent when you are not addressed. You are too young to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contradict your Grandmother, who knows what she is saying."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Smilingly Marfinka drew back into her corner.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No doubt Juliana Andreevna was able to entertain you better, and knows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>better than I how to entertain a Petersburger. What friccassee did she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>give you?" asked his aunt, not without a little real curiosity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vermicelli soup, pastry with cabbage, then beef and potatoes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna laughed ironically, "Vermicelli soup and beef!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And groats in the pan...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It's a long time since you tasted such delicacies."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Excellent dishes," said Tiet Nikonich kindly, "but heavy for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>digestion."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To-morrow, Marfinka," said the old lady, "we will entertain our guest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a gosling, pickled pork, carrots, and perhaps with a goose."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A goose, stuffed with groats, would be acceptable," put in Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Indigestible!" protested Tiet Nikonich. "The best is a light soup, with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pearl barley, a cutlet, pastries and jelly; that is the proper midday</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>meal."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But I should like groats."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you like mushrooms too, Cousin?" asked Marfinka. "Because we have so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>many."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Rather! Can't we have them for supper tonight?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In spite of Tiet Nikonich's caution against this heavy food, Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna sent Marfinka to Peter and to the cook to order mushrooms for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>supper.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If there is any champagne in the cellar, Granny, let us have a bottle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up. Tiet Nikonich and I would like to drink your health. Isn't that so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tiet Nikonich?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, to celebrate your arrival, though mushrooms and champagne are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indigestible."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tell the cook to bring champagne on ice, Marfinka," said the old lady.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>_"Ce que femme veut,"_ said Tiet Nikonich amiably, with a slight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Supper is a special occasion, but one ought to dine at home too. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have vexed your Grandmother by going out on the very day of your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>return."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, Tatiana Markovna," sighed Paulina Karpovna, "our ways here are so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bourgeois, but in the capital...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The old lady's eyes blazed, as she pointed to the wall where hung the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>portraits of Raisky's and the young girls' parents, and exclaimed:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There was nothing bourgeois about those, Paulina Karpovna."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny," said Raisky, "let us allow one another absolute freedom. I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now making up for my absence at midday, and shall be here all night. But</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I can't tell where I shall dine to-morrow, or where I shall sleep."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna could not refrain from applauding, but his aunt looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at him with amazement, and inquired if he were really a gipsy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Monsieur Raisky is a poet, and poets are as free as air," remarked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna. Again she made play with her eyes, shifted the pointed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>toes of her shoes in an effort to arouse Raisky's attention. The more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she twisted and turned, the more icy was his indifference, for her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>presence made an uncomfortable impression on him. Marfinka observed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by-play and smiled to herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have two houses, land, peasants, silver and glass, and talk of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wandering about from one shelter to another like a beggar, like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markushka, the vagrant."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Markushka again! I must certainly make his acquaintance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, don't do that and add to your Grandmother's anxieties. If you see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him, make your escape."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He will lead you astray."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That's of no consequence, Grandmother. It looks as if he were an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>interesting individual, doesn't it, Tiet Nikonich?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is a riddle to everybody," Tiet Nikonich answered with a smile. "He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must have gone astray very early in life, but he has apparently good</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brains and considerable knowledge, and might have been a useful member</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of society."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna turned her head away, and dismissed Mark with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>criticism, "No manners."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Brains! You bought his brains for three hundred roubles. Has he repaid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them?" asked Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I did not remind him of his debt. But to me he is, for the matter of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that, almost polite."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is to say he does not strike you, or shoot in your direction. Just</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>imagine, Boris, that he nearly shot Niel Andreevich."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"His dogs tore my train," complained Paulina Karpovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Did he never visit you unceremoniously at dinner again?" Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna asked Tiet Nikonich.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, you don't like me to receive him, so I refuse him admission. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>once came to me at night," he went on, addressing Raisky. "He had been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out hunting, and had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours. I gave him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>food, and we passed the time very pleasantly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pleasantly!" exclaimed Tatiana Markovna. "How can you say such things?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>If he came to me at that hour, I would settle him. No, Boris Pavlovich,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>live like other decent people. Stay with us, have dinner with us, go out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with us, keep suspicious people at a distance, see how I administer your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>estate, and find fault if I do anything wrong."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is so monotonous, Grandmother. Let us rather live each one after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his own ideas and inclinations."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are an exception," sighed his aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Grandmother, it is you who are an exceptional woman. Why should we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bother about one another."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To please your Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why don't you want to please your Grandson? You are a despot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A despot! Boris Pavlovich, I have waited anxiously for you, I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly slept, have tried to have everything as you liked it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But you did all that because activity is a pleasure to you. All this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>care and trouble is a pleasant stimulant, keeps you busy. If Markushka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>came to you, you would receive him in the same fashion."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are right, Cousin," broke in Marfinka. "Grandmother is kindness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>itself, but she tries to disguise it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't give your opinion when it is not asked. She contradicts her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother only when you are here, Boris Pavlovich; at other times she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is modest enough. And now the ideas she suddenly takes into her head. I?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>entertain Markushka!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You did as you pleased," continued Raisky. "And then when it entered my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head too to do as I pleased, I disturbed your arrangements and made a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breach in your despotism. Isn't that so, Granny? And now kiss me, and we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will give one another full liberty."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a strange boy? Do you hear, Tiet Nikonich, what nonsense he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>talks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On that evening Tatiana Markovna and Raisky concluded, if not peace, at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>least a truce. She was assured that Boris loved and esteemed her; she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was, in truth, easily convinced. After supper Raisky unpacked his trunk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and brought down his gifts; for his aunt, a few pounds of excellent tea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of which she was a connoisseur, a coffee machine of a new kind, with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coffee-pot, and a dark brown silk dress; bracelets with monograms for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his cousins; and for Tiet Nikonich vest and hose of Samian leather, as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his aunt had desired.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna, with tears in her eyes, sat down beside him, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>putting her hand on his shoulder said, "And you remembered me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Whom else should I remember? You are my nearest and dearest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Tiet Nikonich and Paulina Karpovna took leave, the lady said that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had left orders with no one to fetch her, and that she hoped someone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would accompany her, looking towards Raisky as she spoke. Tiet Nikonich</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expressed himself ready to see her home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Egorka could have taken her," whispered Tatiana Markovna. "Why didn't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she stay at home; she was not invited."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank you, thank you," said Paulina Karpovna to Raisky as she passed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What for?" asked Raisky in amazement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For the pleasant, witty conversation, although it was not directed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me. What pleasure it gave me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A practical conversation about groats, a goose, and a quarrel with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, I understand," she continued, "but I caught two glances, which were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intended for me, confess they were. I am filled with hope and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expectation."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As she went out Raisky asked Marfinka what she was talking about.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She's always like that," laughed Marfinka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna followed Raisky to his room, smoothed the sheets of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bed once more, drew the curtains so that the sun should not awaken him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the morning, felt the feather bed to test its softness, and had a jug</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of water placed on the table beside him. She came back three times to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>see if he were asleep or wanted anything. Touched by so much kindly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought he recognised that his grandmother's activity was not only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exerted to gratify herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The days passed quietly by. Every morning the sun climbed up through the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blue air, and lighted up the Volga and its banks. At midday the snowy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>clouds crept up, often piled one on another until the blue sky was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hidden, and the cooling rain fell on woods and fields; then once more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the clouds stole away before the approach of the warm, pleasant evening.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Life at Malinovka passed just as peacefully. The naivetИ of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surroundings had not yet lost its charm for Raisky. The sunshine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>insinuating itself everywhere, his aunt's kind face, Marfinka's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friendliness, and the willing attention of the servants made up a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pleasant, friendly environment. He even felt pleasure in the watchful</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guardianship that his aunt exercised over him; he smiled when she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>preached order to him, warned him of crime and temptation, reproached</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him for his gipsy tendencies and tried to lead him to a definite plan of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He liked Tiet Nikonich, and saw in his courtesy and his extreme good</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>manners, his care for his health, and the universal esteem and affection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in which he was held, a survival from the last century. When he felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>very good tempered he found even Paulina Karpovna's eccentricities</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>amusing. She had induced him to lunch with her one day, when she assured</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him that she was not indifferent to him, and that he himself was on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eve of returning her sentiments!</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The even, monotonous life lulled him like a cradle song. He wrote idly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at his novel, strengthened a situation here, grouped a scene there, or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accentuated a character. He watched his aunt, Leonti and his wife, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, or looked at the villages and fields lying in an enchanted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sleep along the banks of the Volga. In this ocean of silence he caught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>notes which he could interpret in terms of music, and determined, in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>abundant leisure, to pursue the subject.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>One day, after a lonely walk along the shore, he climbed the cliff, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passed Koslov's house. Seeing that the windows were lighted, he was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>going up to the door, when suddenly he heard someone climb over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fence and jump down into the garden. Standing in the shadow of the fence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky hesitated. He was afraid to sound the alarm until he knew whether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it was a thief or an admirer of Juliana Andreevna's, some Monsieur</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Charles or other. However, he decided to pursue the intruder, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>promptly climbed the fence and followed him. The man stopped before a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>window and hammered on the pane.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is no thief, possibly Mark," thought Raisky. He was right.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Philosopher, open! Quick!" cried the intruder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go round to the entrance," said Leonti's voice dully through the glass.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To the entrance, to wake the dog! Open!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait!" said Leonti, and as he opened the window Mark swung himself into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is that behind you. Whom have you brought with you?" asked Leonti</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in terror.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No one. Do you imagine there's a ghost. Ah! there is someone scrambling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Boris, you? How did you happen to arrive together," he exclaimed as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky sprang into the room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark cast a hasty glance on Boris and turned to Leonti. "Give me another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pair of trousers. Have you any wine in the house?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What's the matter, and where have you been?" asked Leonti suddenly, who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had just noticed that Mark was covered up to the waist with wet and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slime.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Give me another pair of trousers quick," said Mark impatiently. "What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is the good of chattering?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have no wine, because we drank it all at dinner, when Monsieur</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Charles was our guest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where do you keep your clothes?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My wife is asleep and I don't know; you must ask Avdotya."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Fool! I will find them myself!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He took a light, and went into the next room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You see what he is like," sighed Leonti, addressing Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After about ten minutes, Mark returned with the trousers and Leonti</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>questioned him as to how he had got wet through.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was crossing the Volga in a fishing-boat. The ass of a fisherman fell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asleep, and brought us right up into the reeds by the island, and we had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to get out among the reeds to extricate the boat."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Without taking any heed of Raisky, he changed his trousers and sat down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with his feet drawn up under him in the great armchair, so that his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knees were on a level with his face, and he supported his bearded chin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>upon them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky observed him silently. Mark was twenty-seven, built as if his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>muscles were iron, and well proportioned; a thick mane of light brown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hair framed his pale face with its high arched forehead, and fell in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>long locks on his neck. The full beard was paler in colour. His open,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bold, irregular, rather thin face was illuminated every now and then by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a smile--of which it was hard to read the meaning; one could not tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whether it spelt vexation, mockery or pleasure. His grey eyes could be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bold and commanding, but for the most part wore a cold expression of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contempt. Tied up in a knot as he was, he now sat motionless with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>staring eyes, stirring neither hand nor foot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>There was something restless and watchful in the motionless attitude, as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in that of a dog apparently at rest, but ready to spring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Suddenly his eyes gleamed, and he turned to Raisky. "You will have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brought some good cigars from St. Petersburg," he began without ceremony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Give me one."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky offered his cigar case, and reminded Leonti that he had not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>introduced them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What need is there of introduction! You came in by the same way, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>both know who the other is."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Words of wisdom from the scholar!" ejaculated Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That same Mark of whom I wrote to you, don't you remember!" said Leonti.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait, I will introduce myself," cried Mark, springing from the easy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chair. He posed ceremoniously, and bowed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have the honour to present myself, Mark Volokov, under police</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surveillance, involuntary citizen of this town."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He puffed away at his cigar, and again rolled himself up in a ball.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you do with yourself here?" asked Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I think, as you do."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You love art, are perhaps an artist?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And are you an artist?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Painter and musician," broke in Leonti, "and now he is writing a novel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Take care, brother, he may put you in too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky signed to him to be silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, I am an artist," Mark went on, "but of a different kind. Your Aunt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will have acquainted you with my works."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She won't hear your name mentioned."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There you have it. But it was only a matter of a hundred apples or so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that I plucked from over the fence."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The apples are mine; you may take as many as you like."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Many thanks. But why should I need your permission? I am accustomed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do everything in this life without permission. Therefore I will take the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>apples without your permission, they taste better."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was curious to make your acquaintance. I hear so many tales about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do they say?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Little that is good."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Probably they tell you I am a thief, a monster, the terror of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neighbourhood."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That's about it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But if this reputation precedes me, why should you seek my acquaintance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I have torn your books, as no doubt our friend there has informed you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There he is to the point," cried Leonti. "I am glad he began the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>subject himself. He is a good sort at the bottom. If one is ill, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>waits on one like a nurse, runs to the chemist, and takes any amount of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trouble. But the rascal wanders round and gives no one any peace."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't chatter so," interrupted Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For that matter," said Raisky, "everybody does not abuse you. Tiet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikonich Vatutin, for instance, goes out of his way to speak well of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it possible! The sugar marquis! I left him some souvenirs of my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>presence. More than once I have waked him in the night by opening his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bedroom window. He is always fussing about his health, but in all the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forty years since he came here no one remembers him to have been ill. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shall never return the money he lent me. What more provocation would he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have? And yet he praises me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So that is your department of art," said Raisky gaily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What kind of an artist are you? It is your turn to tell me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I love and adore beauty. I love art, draw, and make music, and just now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I am trying to write a great work, a novel."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, yes, I see. You are an artist of the kind we all are."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"All?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"With us Russians everybody is an artist. They use the chisel, paint,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strum, write poetry, as you and your like do. Others drive in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mornings to the courts or the government offices, others sit before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their stalls playing draughts, and still others stick on their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>estates--Art is everywhere."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you feel no desire to enter any of these categories."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have tried, but don't know how to. What brought you here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't know myself. It is all the same to me where I go. I had a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>letter summoning me here from my Aunt, and I came."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark busied himself in his thoughts, and took no further interest in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky. Raisky on the other hand examined the extraordinary person</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before him attentively, studied the expression of his face, followed his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>movements, and tried to grasp the outline of a strong character. "Thank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>God," he said to himself, "that I am not the only idle, aimless person</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here. In this man there is something similar; he wanders about,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reconciles himself to his fate, and does nothing. I at least draw and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>try to write my novel, while he does nothing. Is he the victim of secret</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>discord like myself? Is he always struggling between two fires?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Imagination striving upward to the ideal lures him on on the one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hand--man, nature and life in all its manifestations; on the other he is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>attracted by a cold, destructive analysis which allows nothing to live,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and will forget nothing, an analysis that leads to eternal discontent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and blighting cold. Is that his secret?" He glanced at Mark, who was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>already drowsing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good-bye, Leonti," he said, "it's time I was going home."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What am I to do with him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He can stay here all right."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Think of the books. It's leaving the goat loose in the vegetable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>garden."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I might wheel him in the armchair into that dark little room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and lock him in," thought Leonti, "but if he woke, he might pull the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roof down."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark helped him out of his dilemma by jumping to his feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am going with you," he said to Raisky. "It is time for you to go to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bed, philosopher," he said to Leonti. "Don't sit up at nights. You have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>already got a yellow patch in your face, and your eyes are hollow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He put out the light, stuffed on his cap, and leapt out of the window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky followed his example, and they went down the garden once more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>climbed the fence, and came out in the street.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Listen," said Mark. "I am hungry, and Leonti has nothing to give me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Can you help me to storm an inn?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As far as I am concerned. But the thing can be managed without the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>application of force."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is late, and the inns are shut. No one will open willingly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>especially when it is known that I am in the case; consequently we must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enter by storm. We will call 'Fire!' and then they will open at once,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and we can get in."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And be hurled out into the street again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There you are wrong. It is possible that I might be refused entrance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but once in, I remain."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A siege, a row at night...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, you are afraid of the police," laughed Mark. "You are thinking of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what the Governor would decide on in such a serious case, what Niel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Andreevich would say, how the company would take it. Now good-bye, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will go and storm my entrance alone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait, I have another, more delightful plan," said Raisky. "My Aunt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cannot, you say, bear to hear your name; only the other day she declared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she would in no circumstances give you hospitality."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, what then?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Come home with me to supper, and stay the night with me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That's not a bad plan. Let us go."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They walked in silence, almost feeling their way through the darkness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When they came to the fence of the Malinovka estate, which bounded the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vegetable garden, Raisky proposed to climb it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It would be better," said Mark, "to go by way of the orchard or from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the precipice. Here we shall wake the house and must make a circuit in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>addition. I always go the other way."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You--come--here--into the garden? What to do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To get apples."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have my permission, so long as Tatiana Markovna does not catch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I shan't be caught so easily. Look, someone has just leaped over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fence, like us. Hi! Stop! Don't try to hide. Who's there? Halt! Raisky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come and help me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He ran forward a few paces, and seized someone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky hurried to the point from which voices were audible, remarking,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What cat's eyes you have!" The man who was held fast by Mark's strong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arms twisted round to free himself, and in the end fell to the ground</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and made for the fence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Catch him, hold fast! There is another sneaking round in the vegetable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>garden," cried Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky saw dimly a figure about to spring down from the fence, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>demanded who it was.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Sir, let me go, do not ruin me!" whispered a woman's voice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it you, Marina, what are you doing here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Gently, Sir. Don't call me by name. Savili will hear, and will beat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Off with you! No, stop. I have found you at the right moment. Can you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bring some supper to my room?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Anything, Sir. Only, for God's sake, don't betray me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I won't betray you. Tell me what there is in the kitchen."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The whole supper is there. As you did not come, no one ate anything.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There is sturgeon in jelly, turkey, all on ice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Bring it, and what about wine?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is a bottle in the sideboard, and the fruit liqueurs are in Marfa</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna's room."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Be careful not to wake her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She sleeps soundly. Let me go now, Sir, for my husband may hear us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Run, but take care you don't run into him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He dare not do anything if he does meet me now. I shall tell him that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you have given me orders...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Meanwhile, Mark had dragged his man from hiding. "Savili Ilivich," the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unknown murmured, "don't strike me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I ought to know the voice," said Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah! You are not Savili Ilivich, thank God. I Sir, I am the gardener</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from over there."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I came on a real errand, Sir. Our clock has stopped, and I came here to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wait for the church-clock to strike."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Devil take you," cried Mark, and gave the man a push that sent him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reeling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The man sprang over the ditch, and vanished in the darkness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, meantime, returned to the main entrance. He tried to open the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>door, not wishing to knock for fear of awaking his aunt. "Marina," he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>called in a low voice, "Marina, open!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The bolt was pushed back. Raisky pushed open the door with his foot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Before him stood--he recognised the voice--Savili, who flung himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>upon him and held him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait, my little dove, I will make my reckoning with you, not with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Take your hands off, Savili, it is I."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who, not the Master?" exclaimed Savili, loosening his prisoner. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were so good as to call Marina? But," after a pause, "have you not seen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I had already asked her to leave some supper for me and to open the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>door," he said untruthfully, by way of protecting the unfaithful wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She had already heard that I am here. Now let my guest pass, shut the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>door, and go to bed."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Sir," said Savili, and went slowly to his quarters, meeting Marina</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why aren't you in bed, you demon?" she cried, dashing past him. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sneak around at night, you might be twisting the manes of the horses</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like a goblin, and put me to shame before the gentry."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina sped past light-footed as a sylph, skilfully balancing dishes and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>plates in her hands, and vanished into the dark night. Savili's answer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was a threatening gesture with his whip.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark was indeed hungry, and as Raisky showed no hesitation either, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sturgeon soon disappeared, and when Marina came to clear away there was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not much to take.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now we should like something sweet," suggested Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No sweets are left," Marina assured them, "but I could get some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>preserves, of which Vassilissa has the keys."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Better still punch," said Mark. "Have you any rum?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Probably," she said, in answer to an inquiring glance from Raisky. "The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cook was given a bottle this morning for a pudding. I will see."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina returned with a bottle of rum, a lemon and sugar, and then left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the room. The bowl was soon in flames, which lighted up the darkened</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>room with their pale blue light. Mark stirred it with the spoon, while</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sugar held between two spoons dripped slowly into the bowl. From</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time to time he tasted it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How long have you been in our town?" asked Raisky after a short silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"About two years."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must assuredly be bored?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I try to amuse myself," he said, pouring out a glass for himself and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>emptying it. "Drink," he said, pushing a glass towards Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky drank slowly, not from inclination, but out of politeness to his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guest. "It must be essential for you to do something, and yet you appear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to do nothing?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And what do you do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I told you I am an artist."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Show me proof of your art."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At the moment I have nothing except a trifling thing, and even that is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not complete."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He rose from the divan and uncovered Marfinka's portrait.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"H'm, it's like her, and good," declared Mark. He told himself that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had talent. "And it would be excellent, but the head is too large</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in proportion and the shoulders a trifle broad."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He has a straight eye," thought Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I like best the lightly-observed background and accessories, from which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the figure detaches itself light, gay, and transparent. You have found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the secret of Marfinka's figure. The tone suits her hair and her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>complexion."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky recognised that he had taste and comprehension, and wondered if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he were really an artist in a disguise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you know Marfinka?" he asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where have you met my cousins? You do not come to the house."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At church."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At church? But they say you never look inside a church."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't exactly remember where I have seen them, in the village, in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>field."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky concluded his guest was a drunkard, as he drunk down glass after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glass of punch. Mark guessed his thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You think it extraordinary that I should drink. I do it out of sheer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>boredom, because I am idle and have no occupation. But don't be afraid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that I shall set the house on fire or murder anybody. To-day I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drinking more than usual because I am tired and cold. But I am not a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drunkard."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It depends on ourselves whether we are idle or not."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When you climbed over Leonti's fence, I thought you were a sensible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>individual, but now I see that you belong to the same kind of preaching</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>person as Niel Andreevich...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it true that you fired on him?" asked Raisky curiously.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What nonsense! I fired a shot among the pigeons to empty the barrel of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my gun, as I was returning from hunting. He came up and shouted that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should stop, because it was sinful. If he had been content with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>protesting I should merely have called him a fool, and there it would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have ended. But he began to stamp and to threaten, 'I will have you put</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in prison, you ruffian, and will have you locked up where not even the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>raven will bring you a bone.' I allowed him to run through the whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gamut of polite remarks, and listened calmly--and then I 'took aim at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him.'"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And he?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ducked, lost his stick and goloshes, finally squatted on the ground and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whimpered for forgiveness. I shot into the air. That's all."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A pretty distraction," commented Raisky ironically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No distraction," said Mark seriously. "There was more in it, a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>badly-needed lesson for the old boy."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And then what?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nothing. He lied to the Governor, saying that I had aimed at him, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>missed. If I had been a peaceful citizen of the town I should have been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thrust into gaol without delay; but as I am an outlaw, the Governor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inquired into the matter and advised Niel Andreevich to say nothing. So</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that no enquiry should be instituted from St. Petersburg; they fear that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like fire."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When I spoke of idleness," said Raisky, "I did not mean to read a moral.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Yet when I see what your mind, your abilities and your education</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What have you seen? That I can climb a hedge, shoot at a fool, eat and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drink heavily?" he asked as he drained his glass.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky watched him, and wondered uneasily how it would all end.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We were speaking of the art you love so much," said Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have been snatched from Art as if from my mother's breast," sighed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, "but I shall return and shall reach my goal."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, you will not," laughed Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why not, don't you believe in firm intentions?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should I do otherwise, since they say the way to Hell is paved with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them. No, you will do little more than you have accomplished</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>already--that is very little. We, and many like us, simply rot and die.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The only wonder is that you don't drink. That is how our artists,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>half men, usually end their careers."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Smiling he thrust a glass towards his host, but emptied it himself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky concluded that he was cold, malicious and heartless. But the last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remark had disturbed him. Was he really only half a man? Had he not a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>firm determination to reach the goal he had set before himself? He was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only making fun of him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You see that I don't drink away my talents," he remarked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, that is an improvement, a step forward. You haven't succumbed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>society, to perfumes, gloves and dancing. Drinking is a different thing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It goes to one man's head, another is susceptible to passion. Tell me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do you easily take fire? Ah! I have touched the spot," he went on as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky coloured. "That belongs to the artistic temperament, to which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing is foreign--_Nihil humanum_, etc. One loves wine, another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>women, a third cards. The artists have usurped all these things for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>themselves. Now kindly explain what I am."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What you are. Why, an artist, without doubt, who on a first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>acquaintance will drink, storm public houses, shoot, borrow money--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And not repay it. Bravo! an admirable description. To justify your last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remark and prove its truth beyond doubt, lend me a hundred roubles. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will never pay them back unless you and I should have exchanged our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>respective situations in life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You say that in jest?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not at all. The market gardener, with whom I live, feeds me. He has no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>money, nor have I."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky shrugged his shoulders, felt in his pockets, produced his pocket</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>book and laid some notes on the table.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have counted wrong," said Mark. "There are only eighty here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have no more money on me. My aunt keeps my money, and I will send you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the balance to-morrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't forget. This is enough for the moment and now I want to sleep."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My bed is at your disposal, and I will sleep on the divan. You are my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I should be worse than a Tatar if I did that," murmured Mark, already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>half asleep. "Lie down on your bed. Anything will do for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In a few minutes he was sleeping the sleep of a tired, satisfied and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drunken man worn out with cold and weariness. Raisky went to the window,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>raised the curtain, and looked out into the dark, starlit night. Now and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then a flame hovered over the unemptied bowl, flared up and lighted up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the room for a moment. There was a gentle tap on the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is there?" he asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I, Borushka. Open quickly. What are you doing there," said the anxious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>voice of Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky opened the door, and saw his aunt before him, like a white-clad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ghost.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is going on here. I saw a light through the window, and thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you were asleep. What is burning in the bowl."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Rum."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you drink punch at night?" she whispered, looking first at him, then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at the bowl in amazement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am a sinner, Grandmother. Sometimes I drink."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And who is lying there asleep?" she asked in new terror as she gazed on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sleeping Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Gently, Grandmother, don't wake him. It is Mark."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mark! Shall I send for the police! What have you to do with him? You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have been drinking punch at night with Mark? What has come over you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris Pavlovich?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I found him at Leonti's, we were both hungry. So I brought him here and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>we had supper."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why didn't you call me. Who served you, and what did they bring you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marina did everything."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A cold meal. Ah, Borushka, you shame me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We had plenty to eat."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Plenty, without a single hot dish, without dessert. I will send up some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>preserves."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no ... if you want anything, I can wake Mark and ask him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good heavens! I am in my night-jacket," she whispered, and drew back to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the door. "How he sleeps, all rolled up like a little dog. I am ashamed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris Pavlovich, as if we had no beds in the house. But put out the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flames. No dessert!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky extinguished the blue flame and embraced the old lady. She made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sign of the Cross over him, looked round the room once more, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went out on tiptoe. Just as he was going to lie down again there was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another tap on the door, he opened it immediately.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina entered, bearing a jar of preserves; then she brought a bed and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>two pillows. "The mistress sent them," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky laughed heartily, and was almost moved to tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Early in the morning a slight noise wakened Raisky, and he sat up to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark disappear through the window. He does not like the straight way, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought, and stepped to the window. Mark was going through the park, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vanished under the thick trees on the top of the precipice. As he had no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inclination to go to bed again, he put on a light overcoat and went down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the park too, thinking to bring Mark back, but he was already far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>below on the bank of the Volga. Raisky remained standing at the top of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the precipice. The sun had not yet risen, but his rays were already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gilding the hill tops, the dew covered fields were glistening in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>distance, and the cool morning wind breathed freshness. The air grew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rapidly warmer, giving promise of a hot day. Raisky walked on in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>park, and the rain began to fall. The birds sang, as they darted in all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>directions seeking their morning meal, and the bees and the humble-bees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hummed over the flowers. A feeling of discomfort came over Raisky. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had a long day before him, with the impressions of yesterday and the day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before still strong upon him. He looked down on the unchanging prospect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of smiling nature, the woods and the melancholy Volga, and felt the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>caress of the same cooling breeze. He went forward over the courtyard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>taking no notice of the greetings of the servants or the friendly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>advances of the dogs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He intended to go back to his room to turn the tenseness of his mood to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>account as an artistic motive in his novel; but as he hurried past the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old house, he noticed that the door was half open, and went in. Since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his arrival he had only been here for a moment with Marfinka, and had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glanced into Vera's room. Now it occurred to him to make a closer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inspection. Passing through his old bedroom and two or three other rooms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he came into the corner room, then with an expression of extreme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>astonishment in his face he stood still.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leaning on the window-sill, so that her profile was turned towards him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stood a girl of two or three and twenty, looking with strained curiosity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as if she were following some one with her eyes, down to the bank of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volga. He was startled by the white, almost pallid face under the dark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hair, the velvet-black eyes with their long lashes. Her face, still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking anxiously into the distance, gradually assumed an indifferent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expression. The girl glanced hastily over park and courtyard, then as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she turned and caught sight of him, shrank back.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Sister Vera!" he cried.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her face cleared, and her eyes remained fixed on him with an expression</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of modest curiosity, as he approached to kiss her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She drew back almost imperceptibly, turning her head a little so that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his lips touched her cheek, not her mouth, and they sat down opposite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Impatient to hear her voice he began: "How eagerly I have expected you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and you have stayed away so long."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marina told me yesterday that you were here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her voice, though not so clear as Marfinka's, was still fresh and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>youthful.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother wanted to send you word of my arrival, but I begged her not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to tell you. When did you return? No one told me you were here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yesterday, after supper. Grandmother and my sister don't know I am here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yet. No one saw me but Marina."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She threw some white garments that lay beside her into the next room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pushed aside a bundle and brought a table to the window. Then she sat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>down again, with a manner quite unconstrained, as if she were alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have prepared coffee," she said. "Will you drink it with me. It will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be a long time before it is ready at the other house. Marfinka gets up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>late."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I should like it very much," he replied, following her with his eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Like a true artist he abandoned himself to the new and unexpected</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>impression.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must have forgotten me, Vera," he remarked after a pause, with an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affectionate note in his voice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No," she said, as he poured out the coffee, "I remember everything. How</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was it possible to forget you when Grandmother was for ever talking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He would have liked to ask her question after question, but they crowded</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into his brain in so disconnected a fashion that he did not know where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to begin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have already been in your room. Forgive the intrusion," he said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is nothing remarkable here," she said hastily, looking around as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if something not intended for strange eyes might be lying about.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nothing remarkable, quite right. What book is that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He put out his hand for the book under her hand; she rapidly drew it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away and put it behind her on the shelf.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You hide it as you used to hide the currants in your mouth. But show it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you read books that may not be seen?" he said, laughingly as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shook her head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Heavens! how lovely she is!" he thought. And he wondered how such</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beauty could have lost its way in such an outlandish place. He wanted to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>touch some answering chord in her heart, wanted her to reveal something</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of her feelings, but his efforts only produced a greater coldness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My library was in your hands?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, but later Leonid Ivanovich took it over, and I was glad to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>relieved of the charge."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But he must have left you a few books?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh no! I read what I liked, and then surrendered the books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What did you like?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked out of the window as she answered: "A great many. I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>really forgotten."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you care for music?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked at him inquiringly before she said, "Does that mean that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>play myself, or like to hear music?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Both."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't play, but I like to hear music, but what music is there here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But what are your particular tastes?" Again she looked at him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inquiringly. "Do you like housekeeping, or needlework. Do you do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>embroidery?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Marfinka likes and understands all those things."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But what do you like? A book only occupies you for a short time. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>say that you don't do any needlework, but you must like something,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flowers perhaps."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Flowers, yes, in the garden, but not in the house where they have to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tended. I love this corner of God's earth, the Volga, the precipice, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forest and the garden--these are the things I love," she said, looking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contentedly at the prospect from the window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What ties bind you to this little place?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She gave no answer, but her eyes wandered lovingly over the trees and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the rising ground, and finally rested on the dazzling mirror of water.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is a beautiful place," admitted Raisky, "but the view, the river</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bank, the hills, the forest--all these things would became tedious if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they were not inhabited by living creatures which share our feelings and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exchange ideas with us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera!" said Raisky after a pause.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah!" she said, as if she had only just heard his remarks, "I don't live</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alone; Grandmother, Marfinka...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As if you shared your sympathies and thoughts with them. But perhaps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you have a congenial spirit here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera nodded her head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is that happy individual?" he stammered, urged on by envy, terror</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and jealousy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The pope's wife with whom I have been stopping," said Vera as she rose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and shook the crumbs from her apron. "You must have heard of her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The pope's wife!" he repeated.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When she is here with me we both admire the Volga, we are never tired</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of talking about it. Will you have some more coffee? May I have it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cleared away?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The pope's wife," he repeated thoughtfully, without hearing her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>question, and the smile on her lips passed unobserved.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will you have some more coffee?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No. Do you care for Grandmother and Marfinka?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Whom else should I hold dear?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well--me," he retorted, jesting.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You too," she said, looking gaily at him, "if you deserve it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How does one earn this good fortune?" he asked ironically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Love, they say, is blind, gives herself without any merit, is indeed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blind," she rejoined.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yet sometimes love comes consciously, by way of confidence, esteem and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friendship. I should like to begin with the last, and end with the first.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>So what must one do, dear sister, to attract your attention."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not to make such round eyes as you are doing now for instance, not to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>go into my room--without me, not to try to find out what my likes and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dislikes are...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What pride! Tell me, Sister, forgive my bluntness: Do you pride</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself on this? I ask because Grandmother told me you were proud."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother must have her finger in everything. I am not proud. In what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>connection did she say I was?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because I have made a gift of these houses and gardens to you and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka. She said that you would not accept the gift. Is that true?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka has accepted on the condition that you do not refuse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother hesitated, and has not come to a final decision, but waits,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it seems, to see what you will say. And how shall you decide. Will a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sister take a gift from a brother?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, I accept ... but no, I can buy the estate. Sell it to me.... I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have money, and will pay you 50,000 roubles for it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will not do it that way."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked thoughtfully out on the Volga, the precipice, and the park.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Very well. I agree to anything you please, so long as we remain here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will have the deed drawn up."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, thank you!" she said, stretching out both hands to him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He pressed her hands, and kissed Vera on the cheek. She returned the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pressure of his hands and kissed the air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You seem really to love the place and this old house."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you, do you mean to stay here long?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't know. It depends on circumstances--on you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"On me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Come over to the other house."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will follow you. I must first put things straight here. I have not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yet unpacked."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The less Raisky appeared to notice Vera, the more friendly Vera was to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him, although, in spite of her aunt's wishes she neither kissed him nor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>addressed him as "thou." But as soon as he looked at her overmuch or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seemed to hang on her words, she became suspicious, careful and reserved.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her coming made a change in the quiet circle, putting everything in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>different light. It might happen that she said nothing, and was hardly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seen for a couple of days, yet Raisky was conscious every moment of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whereabouts and her doings. It was as if her voice penetrated to him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through any wall, and as if her doings were reflected in any place where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he was. In a few days he knew her habits, her tastes, her likings, all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that love on her outer life. But the indwelling spirit, Vera herself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remained concealed in the shadows. In her conversation she betrayed no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sign of her active imagination and she answered a jest with a gay smile,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but Raisky rarely made her laugh outright. If he did her laughter broke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>off abruptly to give place to an indifferent silence. She had no regular</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>employment. She read, but was never heard to speak of what she read; she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not play the piano, though she sometimes struck discords and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>listened to their effects.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky noticed that their aunt was liberal with observation and warnings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for Marfinka; but she said nothing to Vera, no doubt in the hope that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the good seed sown would bear fruit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera had moments when she was seized with a feverish desire for activity;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and then she would help in the house, and in the most varying tasks with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surprising skill. This thirst for occupation came on her especially when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she read reproach in her aunt's eyes. If she complained that her guests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were too much for her, Vera would not bring herself to assist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>immediately, but presently she would appear in the company with a bright</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face, her eyes gleaming with gaiety, and astonished her aunt by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grace and wit with which she entertained the visitors. This mood would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>last a whole evening, sometimes a whole day, before she again relapsed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into shyness and reserve, so that no one could read her mind and heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>That was all that Raisky could observe for the time, and it was all the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>others saw either. The less ground he had to go on however, the more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>active his imagination was in seeking to divine her secret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She came over every day for a short time, exchanged greetings with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aunt and her sister, and returned to the other house, and no one knew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>how she passed her time there. Tatiana Markovna grumbled a little to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself, complained that her niece was moody, and shy, but did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>insist.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For Raisky the whole place, the park, the estate with the two houses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the huts, the peasants, the whole life of the place had lost its gay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>colours. But for Vera he would long since have left it. It was in this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>melancholy mood that he lay smoking a cigar on the sofa in Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna's room. His aunt who was never happy unless she was doing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>something, was looking through some accounts brought her by Savili;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before her lay on pieces of paper samples of hay and rye. Marfinka was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>working at a piece of lace. Vera, as usual, was not there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa announced visitors; the young master; from Kolchino.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nikolai Andreevich Vikentev, please enter."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka coloured, smoothed her hair, gave a tug to her fichu, and cast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a glance in the mirror. Raisky shook his finger at her, making her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>colour more deeply.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The person who stayed one night here," said Vassilissa to Raisky, "is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>also asking for you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Markushka?" asked Tatiana Markovna in a horrified tone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes," said Vassilissa.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky hurried out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How glad he is, how he rushes to meet him. Don't forget to ask him for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the money. Is he hungry? I will send food directly," cried his aunt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>after him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>There stepped, or rather sprang into the room a fresh-looking,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>well-built young man of middle height of about twenty-three years of age.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had chestnut hair, a rosy face, grey-blue keen eyes, and a smile which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>displayed a row of strong teeth. He laid on a chair with his hat a bunch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of cornflowers and a packet carefully done up in a handkerchief.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good-day, Tatiana Markovna; Good-day, Marfa Vassilievna," he cried. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kissed the old lady's hand, and would have raised Marfinka's to his lips,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but she pulled it away, though he found time to snatch a hasty kiss from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You haven't been to see us for three weeks," said Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reproachfully.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I could not come. The Governor would not let me off. Orders were given</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to settle up all the business in the office," said Vikentev, so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hurriedly that he nearly swallowed some of the words.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is absurd; don't listen to him, Granny," interrupted Marfinka. "He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hasn't any business, as he himself said."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I swear I am up to my neck in work. We are now expecting a new chief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>clerk, and I swear by God we have to sit up into the night."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is not the custom to appeal to God over such trifles. It is a sin,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said Tatiana Markovna severely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you mean? Is it a trifle when Marfa Vassilievna will not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>believe me, and I, by God--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Again?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it true, Tatiana Markovna, that you have a visitor? Has Boris</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pavlovich arrived? Was it he I met in the corridor? I have come on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>purpose--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You see, Granny, he has come to see my cousin. Otherwise he would have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stayed away longer, wouldn't he?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As soon as I could tear myself away, I came here. Yesterday I was at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Kolchino for a minute, with Mama--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is she well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thanks for the kind thought. She sends her kind regards and begs you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not to forget her nameday."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Many thanks. I only don't know whether I can come myself. I am old, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fear the crossing of the Volga."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Without you, Granny, Vera and I will not go. We, too, are afraid of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crossing the Volga."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Be ashamed of yourself, Marfa Vassilievna. What are you afraid of? I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will fetch you myself with our boat. Our rowers are singers."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Under no circumstances will I cross with you. You never sit quiet in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the boat for a minute. What have you got alive in that handkerchief? See,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Granny, I am sure it's a snake."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have brought you a carp, Tatiana Markovna, which I have caught myself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And these are for you, Marfa Vassilievna. I picked the cornflowers here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the rye."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You promised not to pick any without me. Now you have not put in an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appearance for more than two weeks. The cornflowers are all withered,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and what can I do with them?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Come with me, and we'll pick some fresh ones."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait," called Tatiana Markovna. "You can never sit quiet, you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly had time to show your nose, the perspiration still stands on your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forehead, and you are aching to be off. First you must have breakfast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And you, Marfinka, find out if that person, Markushka, will have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anything. But don't go yourself, send Egorka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka seized the carp's head with two fingers, but when he began to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wave his tail hither and thither, she uttered a loud cry, hastily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dropped him on the floor, and fled down the corridor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vikentev hurried after, and a few moments later Tatiana Markovna heard a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gay waltz in progress and a vigorous stampede, as if someone were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rolling down the steps. Soon the two of them tore across the courtyard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the garden, Marfinka leading, and from the garden came the sound of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chattering, singing and laughter. Tatiana Markovna shook her head as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked through the window. Cocks, hens and ducks fled in panic, the dogs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dashed barking at Marfinka's heels, the servants put their heads out of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the windows of their quarters, in the garden the tall plants swayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hither and hither, the flower beds were broken by the print of flying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feet, two or three vases were overturned, and every bird sought refuge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the depths of the trees.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, the two culprits sat with Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as politely as if nothing had happened. They looked gaily about the room</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and at one another, as Vikentev wiped the perspiration from his face and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka fanned her burning face with her handkerchief.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are a nice pair," remarked Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is always like that," complained Marfinka, "he chased me. Tell him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to sit quiet."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It wasn't my fault, Tatiana Markovna. Marfa Vassilievna told me to go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the garden, and she herself ran on in front."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is a man. But it does not become you, who are a girl, to do these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You see what I have to endure through you," said Marfinka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Never mind, Marfa Vassilievna. Granny is only scolding a little, as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is privileged to do."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you say, Sir?" said Tatiana Markovna, catching his words. "Come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here, and since your Mama is not here, I will box your ears for you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But, Tatiana Markovna, you threaten these things and never do them," he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said, springing up to the old lady and bowing his head submissively.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do box his ears well, Granny, so that his ears will be red for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>month."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How did you come to be made of quicksilver?" said Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affectionately. "Your late father was serious, never talked at random,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and even disaccustomed your mother from laughter!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, Marfa Vassilievna," broke in Vikentev. "I have brought you some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>music and a new novel."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where are they?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I left them in the boat. That's the fault of the carp. I will go and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fetch them now."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In a moment he was out of the door, and Marfinka would have followed if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her aunt had not detained her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What I wanted to say to you is----" she began.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She hesitated a little, as if she could not make up her mind to speak.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka came up to her, and the old lady smoothed her disordered hair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What then, Granny?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are a good child, and obey every word of your grandmother's. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are not like Veroshka...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't find fault with Veroshka, Granny!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, you always defend her. She does indeed respect me, but she retains</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her own opinion and does not believe me. Her view is that I am old,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>while you two girls are young, know everything, and read everything. If</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only she were right. But everything is not written in books," she added</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a sigh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you want to say to me?" asked Marfinka curiously.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That a grown girl must be a little more cautious. You are so wild, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>run about like a child."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not always running about. I work, sew embroider, pour out tea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>attend to the household. Why do you scold me, Grandmother," she asked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with tears in her eyes. "If you tell me I must not sing, I won't do it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God grant that you may always be as happy as a bird. Sing, play----"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then, why scold me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't scold you; I only ask you to keep within bounds. You used to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>run about with Nikolai Andreevich--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka reddened and retired to her corner.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is no harm," continued Tatiana Markovna. "There is nothing against</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikolai Andreevich, but he is just as wild as you are. You are my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dearest child, and you will remember what is due to your dignity."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka blushed crimson.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't blush, darling. I know that you will do nothing wrong, but for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other people's sake you must be careful. Why do you look so angry. Come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and let me kiss you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nikolai Andreevich will be here in a moment, and I don't know how to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Before Tatiana Markovna could answer Vikentev burst in, covered with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dust and perspiration, carrying music and a book which he laid on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table by Marfinka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Give me your hand, Marfa Vassilievna," he cried, wiping his forehead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How I did run, with the dogs after me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka hid her hand, bowed, and returned with dignity:</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>_"Je vous remercie, monsieur Vikentev, vous Йtes bien amiable."_</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He stared first at Marfinka, then at her aunt, and asked whether she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would try over a song with him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will try it by myself, or in company with Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let us go into the park, and I will read you the new novel," he then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said, picking up the book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How could I do such a thing?" asked Marfinka, looking demurely at her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aunt. "Do you think I am a child?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the meaning of this, Tatiana Markovna," stammered Vikentev in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>amazement. "Marfa Vassilievna is unendurable." He looked at both of them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>walked into the middle of the room, assumed a sugary smile, bowed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slightly, put his hat under his arm, and struggling in vain to drag his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gloves on his moist hands began: "_Mille pardons, mademoiselle, de</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vous avoir dИrangИe. Sacrebleu, ca n'entre pas. Oh mille pardons,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mademoiselle_."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do stop, you foolish boy!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka bit her lips, but could not help laughing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Just look at him, Granny! How can anybody keep serious when he mimics</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Monsieur Charles so nicely?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Stop, children," cried Tatiana Markovna, her frown relaxing into smiles.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go, and God be with you. Do whatever you like."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky's patience had to suffer a hard trial in Vera's indifference. His</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>courage failed him, and he fell into a dull, fruitless boredom. In this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>idle mood he drew village scenes in his sketch album--he had already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sketched nearly every aspect of the Volga to be seen from the house or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the cliff--and he made notes in his note books. He hoped by these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>occupations to free himself from his obsessing thoughts of Vera. He knew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he would do better to begin a big piece of work, instead of these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trifles. But he told himself that Russians did not understand hard work,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or that real work demanded rude strength, the use of the hands, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shoulders and the back. He thought that in work of this kind a man lost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consciousness of his humanity, and experienced no pleasures in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exertions; he shouldered his burden like a horse that seeks to ward off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the whip with his tail. Rough manual labour left no place for boredom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Yet no one seeks distractions in work, but in pleasure. Work, not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appearances, he repeated, oppressed by the overpowering dulness which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drove him nearly mad, and created a frame of mind quite contrary to his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gentle temperament. I have no work, I cannot create as do artists who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are absorbed in their work, and are ready to die for it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He took his cap and strolled into the outlying parts of the town, then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the town, where he observed every passer-by, stared into the houses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>down the streets, and at last found himself standing before the Koslov's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house. Being told that Koslov was at the school, he inquired for Juliana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Andreevna. The woman who had opened the door to him, looked at him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>askance, blew her nose with her apron, wiped it with her finger, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vanished into the house for good. He knocked again, the dogs barked, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then appeared a little girl, holding her finger to her mouth, who stared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at him and departed. He was about to knock again, but, instead, turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to go. As he passed through the little garden he heard voices, Parisian</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>French, and a woman's voice; he heard laughter and even a kiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Poor Leonti!" he whispered. "Or rather, blind Leonti!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He stood uncertain whether to go or stay, then hastened his steps, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>determined to have speech with Mark. He sought distraction of some kind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to rid himself of his mood of depression, and to drive away the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>insistent thoughts of Vera. Passing the warped houses, he left the town</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and passed between two thick hedges beyond which stretched on both sides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vegetable gardens.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where does the market gardener, Ephraim, live?" he asked, addressing a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman over the hedge who was working in the beds.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Silently, without pausing in her work, she motioned with her elbow to a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hut standing isolated in the field. As he climbed over the fence, two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dogs barked furiously at him. From the door of the hut came a healthy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young woman with sunburnt face and bare arms, holding a baby.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She called off the dogs with curses, and asked Raisky whom he wished to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>see. He was looking curiously round, since he did not understand how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anyone except the peasant and his wife could be living there. The hut,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>against which were propped spades, rakes and other tools, planks and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pails, had neither yard nor fence; two windows looked out on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vegetable garden, two others on the field. In the shed were two horses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here was a pig surrounded by a litter of young, and a hen wandered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>around with her chickens. A little further off stood some cars and a big</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>telega.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does Mark Volokov live here?" asked Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The woman pointed to the telega in silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That's his room," she said, pointing to one of the windows. "He sleeps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the telega."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At this time of day?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He only came home this morning, probably rather drunk."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky approached the telega.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you want of him?" asked the woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To visit him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let him sleep."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am frightened here alone with him, and my husband won't be here yet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I hope he'll sleep."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does he insult you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, it would be wicked to say such a thing. But he is so restless and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>peculiar that I am afraid of him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She rocked the child in her arms, and Raisky looked curiously under the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>straw covering. Suddenly Mark's tangled hair and beard emerged and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman vanished into the hut as he cried, "Fool, you don't know how to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>receive visitors."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good-day! What has brought you here?" cried Mark as he crawled out of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the telega and stretched himself. "A visit, perhaps."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was taking a walk out of sheer boredom."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Bored! with two beautiful girls at home. You, an artist, and you are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>taking a walk out of sheer boredom. Don't your affections prosper?" he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>winked. "They are lovely children, especially Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How do you know my cousins, and in what way do they concern you?" asked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky drily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't be vexed. Come into my drawing-room."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tell me rather why you sleep in the telega. Are you playing at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Diogenes?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, because I must."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They entered the hut and went into a boarded compartment, where stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark's bed with a thin old mattress, a thin wadded bed-cover and a tiny</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pillow. Scattered on a shelf on the wall, and on the table lay books,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>two guns hung on the wall, linen and clothes were tumbled untidily on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the only chair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"This is my salon, sit down on the bed, and I will sit on the chair. Let</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>us take off our coats, for it is infernally hot. No ceremony, as there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are no ladies. That's right. Do you want anything? There is nothing but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>milk and eggs. If you don't want any, give me a cigar."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Many thanks. I have already breakfasted, and it will presently be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dinner time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes! You live with your Aunt. Weren't you expelled after having</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>harboured me in the night?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"On the contrary, she reproached me with having allowed you to go to bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without any dessert, and for not having demanded pillows."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And didn't she rail against me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As usual, but...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I know it is habit and does not come from her heart. She has the best</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart one can wish for, better than any here. She is bold, full of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>character, and with a solid understanding; now indeed her brain is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>weakening...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is your opinion? You have found someone for whom you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sympathy?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, especially in one respect. She cannot endure the Governor any more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>than I can. I don't know what her reasons are; his position is enough</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for me. We neither of us like the police; we are oppressed by them. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old lady is compelled by them to carry out all sorts of repairs; to me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they pay far too much attention, find out where I live, whether I go far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from the town, and whom I visit."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Both fell silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now we have nothing more to talk about. Why did you come here?" asked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because I was bored."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Fall in love."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky was silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"With Vera," continued Mark. "Splendid girl, and she is related to you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It must be easy for you to begin a romance with her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky made an angry gesture, to which Mark replied by a burst of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>laughter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Call the ancient wisdom to your help," he said. "Show outward coldness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when you are inwardly consumed, indifference of manner, pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contempt--every little helps. Parade yourself before her as suits</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your calling."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My calling?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Isn't it your calling to be eccentric?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Perhaps," remarked Raisky indifferently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I, for instance," said Mark, "should make direct for my goal, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should be sure of victory. You may do the same, but you would do so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>penetrated by the conviction that you stood on the heights and had drawn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her up to you, you idealist. Show that you understand your calling, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you may succeed. It's no use to wear yourself out with sighs, to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sleepless, to watch for the raising of the lilac curtain by a white hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to wait a week for a kindly glance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky rose, furious.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, I have hit the bull's eye."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky put compulsion on himself to restrain his rage, for every</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>involuntary expression or gesture of anger would have meant nothing less</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>than acquiescence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I should very well like to fall in love, but I cannot," he yawned,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>counterfeiting indifference. "It is unsuited to my years and doesn't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cure my boredom."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Try it," teased Mark. "Let us have a wager that in a week you will be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as enamoured as a young cat. And within two months, or perhaps one, you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will have perpetrated so many follies that you will not know how to get</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away from here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I am, with what will you pay?" asked Raisky in a tone bordering on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contempt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will give you my trousers or my gun. I possess only two pairs of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trousers. The tailor has recovered a third pair for debt. Wait, I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>try on your coat. Why, it fits as if I were poured into a mould. Try</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mine."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I should like to see whether it suits you. Please try it on, do."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky was indulgent enough to allow himself to be persuaded, and put on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark's worn, dirty coat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, does it suit?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It fits!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wear it then. You don't wear a coat long, while for me it lasts for two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>years. Besides, whether you are contented or not I shan't take yours off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my shoulders. You would have to steal it from me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does the wager hold!" asked Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What put you on to that--you will excuse me--ridiculous idea?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't excuse yourself. Does it hold?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The wager is not equal. You have no possessions."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't be disturbed on that account. I shall not have to pay. If my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>prophecy comes true, then you will pay me three hundred roubles, which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would come in very conveniently."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What nonsense," said Raisky, as he stood up and reached for his cap and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stick.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At the latest you will be in love in a fortnight. In a month you will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be groaning, wandering about like a ghost, playing your part in a drama,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or possibly in a tragedy, and ending, as all your like do, with some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>piece of folly. I know you, I can see through you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But if, instead my falling in love with her, she were to fall in love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with me...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera! with you!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Vera, with me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then I will find a double pledge, and bring it to you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are a madman!" said Raisky, and went without bestowing a further</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glance on Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In one month's time I shall have won three hundred roubles," Mark cried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>after him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky walked angrily home. "I wonder where our charmer is now," he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wondered gloomily. "Probably sitting on her favourite bench, admiring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the view. I will see." As he knew Vera's habits, he could say with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nearly complete certainty where she would be at any hour of the day. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went over to the precipice, and saw her, as he had thought, sitting on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the bench with a book in her hand. Instead of reading she looked out,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now over the Volga, now into the bushes. When she saw Raisky, she rose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slowly and walked over to the old house. He signed to her to wait for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him, but she either did not perceive the sign, or did not wish to do so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When she reached the courtyard she quickened her steps, and disappeared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>within the door of the old house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky could hardly control his rage. "And a stupid girl like that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thinks that I am in love with her," he thought. "She has not the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remotest conception of manners." In offering the wager, Mark had stirred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up all the bitterness latent in him. He hardly looked at Vera when he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sat opposite her at dinner. If he happened to raise his eyes, it was as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if he were dazed by a flash of lightning. Once or twice she had looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at him in a kind, almost affectionate way, but his wild glance betrayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to her the agitation, of which she deemed herself to be the cause, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to avoid meeting his eyes she bent her head over her empty plate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"After dinner, I shall drive with Marfinka to the hay harvest," said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna to Raisky. "Will you bestow on your meadows the honour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of your presence, Sir?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have no inclination to go," he murmured.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does the world go so hard with you?" asked Tatiana Markovna. "You are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indeed weighed down with work."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked at Vera, who was mixing red wine with water. She emptied her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glass, rose, kissed her aunt's hand, and went out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky too rose, and went to his room. His aunt, Marfinka, and Vikentev,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who had just happened to turn up, drove to the hay harvest, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afternoon peace soon reigned over the house. One man crawled into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hayrick, another in the outhouse, another slept in the family carriage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>itself, while others took advantage of the mistress's absence to go into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the outskirts of the town.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky's thoughts were filled with Vera. Although he had sworn to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself to think of her no more, he could not conquer his thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Where was she? He would go to her and talk it all over. He was inspired</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only with curiosity, he assured himself. He took his cap and hurried out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera was neither in the room nor in the old house; he searched for her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in vain on the field, in the vegetable garden, in the thicket on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cliff, and went to look for her down along the bank of the Volga. When</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he found no one he turned homewards, and suddenly came across her a few</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>steps from him, not far from the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah!" he cried, "there you are. I have been hunting for you everywhere."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And I have been waiting for you here," she returned.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He felt as if he were suddenly enveloped in winter in the soft airs of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the South.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You--waiting for me," he said in a strange voice, and looked at her in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>astonishment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I wanted to ask you why you pursue me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky looked at her fixedly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I hardly ever speak to you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is true that you rarely talk to me, but you look at me in such a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wild and extraordinary fashion that it constitutes a kind of pursuit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And that is not all; you quietly follow my steps. You get up earlier</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>than I do, and wait for me to wake, draw my curtains back, and open the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>window; whatever way I take in the park, and wherever I sit down, I must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>meet you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Very rarely."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Three or four times a week. It would not be often and would not annoy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me, quite the reverse, if it occurred without intention. But in your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes and steps I see only one thing, the continual effort to give me no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>peace, to master my every glance, word and thought."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He was amazed at her boldness and independence, at the freedom of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>speech. He saw before him, as he imagined, the little girl who had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nervously concealed herself from him for fear that her egoism might</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffer through the inequality of her brains, her ideas and her education.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This was a new figure, a new Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What if all this exists only in your imagination?" he said undecidedly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't lie to me," she interrupted. "If you are successful in observing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my every footstep, my every moment, at least permit me to be conscious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the discomfort of such observation. I tell you plainly that it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>oppresses me; it is slavery; I feel like a prisoner."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you ask of me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My freedom."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Freedom--I am your chevalier--therefore...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Therefore you will not leave a poor girl room to breathe. Tell me, what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reason have I given you to regard me differently from any other girl?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Beauty adores admiration; it is her right."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Beauty has also a right to esteem and freedom. Is it an apple hanging</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the other side of the hedge, that every passer-by can snatch at?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't agitate yourself, Vera!" he begged, taking her hands. "I confess</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my guilt. I am an artist, have a susceptible temperament, and perhaps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>abandoned myself too much to my impressions. Then I am no stranger. Let</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>us be reconciled, Vera. Tell me your wishes, and they shall be sacredly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fulfilled. I will do what pleases you, will avoid what offends you, in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>order to deserve your friendship."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I told you from the beginning, you remember, how you could show me your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sympathy, by not observing me, by letting me go my way and taking no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>notice of me. Then I will come of myself, and we will fix the hours that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>we will spend together, reading or walking."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You ask me, Vera, to be utterly indifferent to you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not to notice how lovely you are? To look at you as if you were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother. But even if I adore your beauty in silence from a distance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you would know it, and can you forbid me that? Passion may melt the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surface and there may steal into your heart an affection for me. Don't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>let me leave you without any hope. Can you not give me any?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How can you tell? There may come a time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Cousin, never."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Unmanned by terror, he collected his strength to say breathlessly:</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are no longer free? You love?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She knit her brow and looked down on the Volga.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And is there any sin if I do? Will you not permit it, Cousin?" she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked ironically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I! I, who bring you the lofty philosophy of freedom, how should I not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>permit you to love. Love independently of everybody, conceal nothing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fear neither Granny nor anyone else. The dawn of freedom is red in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sky, and shall woman alone be enslaved? You love. Say so boldly, for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passion is happiness, and allow others at least to envy you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I concede no one the right to call me to account; I am free."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But you are afraid of Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am afraid of no one. Grandmother knows it, and respects my freedom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And my wish is that you should follow her example. That is all I wanted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to say," she concluded as she rose from the bench.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Vera, now I understand, and am in accord with you," he replied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rising also. "Here is my hand on it, that from to-day you will neither</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hear nor notice my presence."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She gave her hand, but drew it rapidly back as he pressed it to his lips.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We will see," she said. "But if you don't keep your word, we will see--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Say all you have to say, Vera, or my head will go to pieces."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera looked long at the prospect before her before she ended with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>decision:</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then however dearly I love this place, I will leave it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To go where?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God's world is wide. Au revoir, Cousin!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A few days later Raisky got up about five o'clock. The sun was already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>full on the horizon, a wholesome freshness rose from garden and park,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flowers breathed a deeper perfume, and the dew glittered on the grass.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He dressed quickly and went out into the garden, when he suddenly met</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is not intentional, not intentional, I swear," he stammered in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>first surprise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They both laughed. She picked a flower, threw it to him, and gave him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her hand; and in reply to the kiss he gave she kissed him on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forehead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It was not intentional, Vera," he repeated. "You see yourself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I see you are good and kind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Generous," he added.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We have not got to generosity yet," she said laughing, and took his arm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let us go for a walk; it's a lovely morning."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He felt unspeakably happy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What coat are you wearing?" she asked in surprise as they walked. "It</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is not yours."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, it is Mark's."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is he here? How did you come by his coat?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you frightened? The whole house fears him like fire?" And he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>explained how he got the coat. She listened absently as they went</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silently down the main path of the garden, Vera with her eyes on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Against his will he felt impelled to seek another argument with her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You seem to have something on your mind," she began, "which you do not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wish to tell."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I did wish to, but I feared the storm I might draw upon myself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You did not wish to discuss beauty once more?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no, I want to explain what my feeling for you is. I am convinced</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that this time I am not in error. You have opened to me a special door</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of your heart, and I recognise that your friendship would bring great</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness, and that its soft tones would bring colour into my dull life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Do you think, Vera, that friendship is possible between a man and a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why not? If two such friends can make up their minds to respect one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another's freedom, if one does not oppress the other, does not seek to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>discover the secret of the other's heart, if they are in constant,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>natural intercourse, and know how to respect secrets...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His eyes blazed. "Pitiless woman," he broke in.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She had seen the glance, and lowered her eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We will go in to Grandmother. She has just opened the window, and will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>call us to tea?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"One word more, Vera. You have wisdom, lucidity, decision...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is wisdom?" she asked mischievously.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Observation and experience, harmoniously applied to life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have hardly any experience."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nature has bestowed on you a sharp eye and a clear brain."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is not such a possession disgraceful for a girl?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your wholesome ideas, your cultivated speech...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are surprised that a drop of village wisdom should have descended</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on your poor sister. You would have preferred to find a fool in my place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wouldn't you, and now you are annoyed?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Vera, you intoxicate me. You do indeed forbid me to mention your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beauty by so much as a syllable, and will not hear why I place it so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>high. Beauty is the aim and at the same time the driving power of art,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and I am an artist. The beauty of which I speak is no material thing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she does not kindle her fires with the glow of passionate desire alone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>more especially she awakens the man in man, arouses thought, inspires</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>courage, fertilises the creative power of genius, even when that genius</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stands at the culmination of its dignity and power; she does not scatter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her beams for trifles, does not besmirch purity--she is womanly wisdom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You are a woman, Vera, and understand what I mean. Your hand will not be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>raised to punish the man, the artist, for this worship of beauty."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"According to you wisdom lies in keeping these rules before one's eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as the guiding thread of life, in which case I am not wise, I have not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'received this baptism.'"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>An emotion closely related to sadness shone in her eyes, as she gazed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>upwards for a moment before she entered the house. Raisky anxiously told</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself that she was as enigmatic as night itself, and he wondered what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was the origin of these foreign ideas and whether her young life was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>already darkened.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On Sunday Tatiana Markovna had guests for the second breakfast. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>covers had been removed from the purple damask-covered chairs in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reception room. Yakob had rubbed the eyes of the family portraits with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>damp rag, and they appeared to look forth more sharply than on ordinary</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>days. The freshly waxed floors shone. Yakob himself paraded in a dress</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coat and a white necktie, while Egorka, Petrushka and Stepka, the latter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of whom had been fetched from the village and had not yet found his legs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had been put into old liveries which did not fit them and smelt of moth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The dining-room and the reception room had been fumigated just before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the meal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna herself, in a silk dress and shawl, with her cap on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back of her head, sat on the divan. Near her the guests had taken their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>places in accordance with their rank and dignity. The place of honour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was occupied by Niel Andreevich Tychkov, in a dress coat with an order,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an important old gentleman whose eyebrows met in his great fat face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>while his chin was lost in his cravat. The consciousness of his dignity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appeared in every gesture and in his condescending speech. Next him sat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the invariably modest Tiet Nikonich, also in a dress coat, with a glance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of devotion for Tatiana Markovna, and a smile for all. Then followed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>priest in a silk gown with a broad embroidered girdle, the councillors</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the local court, the colonel of the garrison, ladies from the town;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young officials who stood talking in undertones in a corner; young girls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friends of Marfinka, who timidly clasped their damp hands and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>continually changed colour; finally a proprietor from the neighbourhood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with three half-grown sons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When the company had already been assembled for some little time at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breakfast-table, Raisky entered. He felt that he was playing the rТle of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an actor, fresh to the place, making his first appearance on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>provincial stage after the most varying reports had been spread about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna introduced him as "My nephew, the son of my late niece</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sfonichka," though everybody knew who he was. Several people stood up to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>greet him. Niel Andreevich, who expected that he would come and speak to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him, gave him a friendly smile; the ladies pulled their dresses straight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and glanced at the mirror; the young officials who were standing eating</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>off their plates in the corner shifted from one foot to the other; and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the young girls blushed still more and pressed their hands as if danger</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>threatened.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky bowed to the assembled guests, and sat down beside his aunt on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Look how he throws himself down," whispered a young official to his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neighbour. "His Excellency is looking at him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Niel Andreevich has been wanting to see you for a long time," said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna aloud, adding under her breath, "His Excellency, don't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forget." In the same low tone Raisky asked who the little lady was with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the fine teeth and the well-developed figure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Shame, Boris Pavlovich," and aloud, "Niel Andreevich, Borushka has been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>desiring to present himself to you for a long time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky was about to reply when Tatiana Markovna pressed his hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enjoining silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why have you not given me the pleasure of a visit from you before,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said Niel Andreevich with a kindly air. "Good men are always welcome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But it is not amusing to visit us old people, and the new generation do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not care for us, do they? And you hold with the young people. Answer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>frankly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do not divide mankind into the old and the new generation," said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, helping himself to a slice of cake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't hurry about eating; talk to him," whispered Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will eat and talk at the same time," he returned aloud.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna looked confused, and turned her back on him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't disturb him," continued Niel Andreevich. "Young people are like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that. I am curious to know how you judge men, Boris Pavlovich."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"By the impression they produce on me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Admirable. I like you for your candour. Let us take an example. What is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your opinion of me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am afraid of you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Niel Andreevich laughed complacently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tell me why. You may speak quite plainly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why I am afraid of you? They say you find fault with everybody," he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went on, heedless of Tatiana Markovna's efforts to interrupt. "My</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother tells me that you lectured one man for not having attended</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mass."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna went hot all over, and taking off her cap, put it down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am glad she told you that. I like to have my doings correctly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reported. Yes, I do lecture people sometimes. Do you remember?" he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appealed to the young men at the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At your service, your Excellency," answered one of them quickly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>putting one foot forward and his hands behind his back. "I once received</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was unsuitably dressed."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You came to me one Sunday after Mass. I was glad to see you, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>instead of appearing in a dress coat, you came in a short jacket."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At this point Paulina Karpovna rustled in, wearing a muslin dress with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wide sleeves so that her white arms were visible almost to the shoulder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She was followed by a cadet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What heat! _Bonjour, Bonjour_," she cried, nodding in all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>directions, and then sat down on the divan beside Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is not room here," he said, and sat down on a chair beside her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, Dalila Karpovna," remarked Niel Andreevich. "Good-day. How are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good-day," she answered drily, turning away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why don't you bestow a kind glance on me, and let me admire your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>swanlike neck!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The young officials in the corner giggled, the ladies smiled, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna whispered to Raisky: "The rude creature. The first word</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he speaks is folly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, you despise an old man. But if I were to seek for your hand? Do I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>look like a bridegroom, or am I too old for you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I decline the honour. _Bonjour_, Natalie Ivanovna, where did you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>buy that pretty hat, at Madame Pichet's?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My husband ordered it from Moscow, as a surprise for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Very pretty."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But listen seriously," cried Niel Andreevich insistently. "I am going</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to woo you in earnest. I need a housekeeper, a modest woman, who is no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coquette, and has no taste for finery, who never glances at another man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and you are an example."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna pretended not to hear, but fanned herself and attempted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to draw Raisky into a conversation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In our esteem," went on Niel Andreevich, pitilessly, "you are a model</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for our mothers and daughters. At church your eyes remain fixed on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sacred picture without a moment's diversion, and never even perceive the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>presence of young men...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The giggling in the corner increased, the ladies made faces in their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>efforts to restrain their laughter, and Tatiana Markovna tried to divert</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Niel Andreevich's attention from her guest, by herself addressing her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but he returned to the attack.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are as retiring as a nun," he went on, "never display your arms and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shoulders, but bear yourself in accordance with your years."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why don't you leave me alone?" returned Paulina Karpovna, and turning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Raisky she added: "_Est-il bЙte, grossier_."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because I wish to marry you, we are a suitable pair."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It will be difficult to find a wife for you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We are well matched. I was still an assessor when you married the late</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivan Egorovich. And that must be--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How hot it is! Stifling! Let us go into the garden. Please give me my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mantilla, Michel," she said turning to the cadet who had come with her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At this moment Vera appeared, and the company rose and crowded round her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so that the conversation took another turn. Raisky was bored by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guests, and by the exhibition he had just witnessed. He would have left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the room, but that Vera's presence provided a strong incentive to remain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera looked quickly round at the guests, said a few words here and there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shook hands with the young girls, smiled at the ladies, and sat down on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a chair by the stove. The young officials smoothed their coats, Niel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Andreevich kissed her hand with evident pleasure, and the girls fixed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their eyes on her. Meanwhile Marfinka was busily employed in pouring out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time, handing dishes and particularly in entertaining her friends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera Vassilievna, my dear, do take my part," cried Niel Andreevich.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is any one offending you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Indeed there is. There is Dalila, no, Pelageia Karpovna--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Impertinent creature," said that lady aloud, as she rose and went</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quickly towards the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna also rose. "Where are you going, Paulina Karpovna?" she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cried. "Marfinka, do not let her go."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no, Tatiana Markovna," came Paulina Karpovna's voice from the hall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am always grateful to you, but I do not wish to meet such a loon. If</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my husband were alive, no man would dare...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not be vexed; he means nothing by it, but is in reality a decent old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gentleman."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Please let me go. I will come again and see you when he is not here,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she said as she left the house in tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the room she had left everyone was in gay humour, and Niel Andreevich</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>condescended to share the general laughter, in which however, neither</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky nor Vera joined. Paulina Karpovna might be eccentric, but that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not excuse either the loonish amusement of the people assembled or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the old man's attacks. Raisky remained gloomily silent, and shifted his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feet ominously.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She is offended and has departed," remarked Niel Andreevich, as Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna, visibly agitated returned, and resumed her seat in silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It won't do her any harm, but will be good for her health. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shouldn't appear naked in society. This is not a bathing establishment."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At this point the ladies lowered their eyes, and the young girls grew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crimson, and pressed their hands nervously together.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Neither should she stare about her in church and have young men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>following her footsteps. Come, Ivan Ivanovich, you were once her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indefatigable cavalier. Do you still visit her?" he asked a young man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>severely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not for a long time, your Excellency. I got tired of forever exchanging</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>compliments."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It's a good thing you have given it up. What an example she sets to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>women and young girls, going about dressed in pink with ribbons and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>frills, when she is over forty. How can anybody help reading her a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lecture? You see," he added turning to Raisky. "that I am only a terror</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to evildoers. Who has made you fear me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mark," answered Raisky, to the excitement of all present.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What Mark?" asked Niel Andreevich, frowning.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mark Volokov, who is in exile here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah! that thief. Do you know him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We are friends."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Friends!" hissed the old man. "Tatiana Markovna, what do I hear?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't believe him, Niel Andreevich. He does not know what he is talking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about. What sort of a friend of yours is he?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why, Grandmother, did he not sup here with me and spend the night?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Didn't you yourself give orders to have a soft bed made up for him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Boris Pavlovich, for pity's sake, be silent," whispered his aunt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>angrily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But Tychkov was already looking at her with amazement, the ladies with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sympathy, while the men stared and the young girls drew closer to one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another. Vera looked round the company, thanking Raisky by a friendly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glance, and Marfinka hid behind her aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a confession! You admitted this Barabbas under your roof," said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Niel Andreevich.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not I, Niel Andreevich. Borushka brought him in at night, and I did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>even know who was sleeping in his room."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You go round with him at night? Don't you know that he is a suspicious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>character, an enemy of the administration, a renegade from Church and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Society. So he has been telling you about me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes," Raisky said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"By his description I am a wild beast, a devourer of men."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, you do not devour them, but you allow yourself, by what right God</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only knows, to insult them."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And did you believe that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Until to-day, no."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And to-day?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To-day, I believe it," agreed Raisky to the terror and agitation of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>company. Most of the officials present escaped to the hall, and stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>near the door listening.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How so," asked Niel Andreevich haughtily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because you have just insulted a lady."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You hear, Tatiana Markovna."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Boris Pavlovich, Borushka," she said, seeking to restrain him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That old fashion-plate, that frivolous, dangerous woman!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do her faults matter to you. Who gave you the right to judge other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>people?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who gave you the right, young man, to reproach me? Do you know that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have been in the service for forty years, and that no minister has ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made the slightest criticism to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My right is that you have insulted a lady in my house. I should be a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>miserable creature to permit that. If you don't understand that, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>worse for you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you receive a person who is, to the knowledge of the whole town,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a frivolous butterfly, dressing in a way unsuited to her age, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leaving unfulfilled her duties to her family...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, what then?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then both you and Tatiana Markovna deserve to hear the truth. Yes, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have been meaning to tell you for a long time, Matushka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Frivolity, flightiness and the desire to please are not such terrible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crimes. But the whole town knows that you have accumulated money through</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bribery that you robbed your own nieces and had them locked up in an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asylum. Yet my Grandmother and I have received you in our house, and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>take it upon yourself to lecture us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The guests who heard this indictment were horror-stricken. The ladies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hurried out into the hall without taking leave of their hostess, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rest followed them like sheep, and soon all were gone. Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>motioned Marfinka and Vera to the door, but Marfinka alone obeyed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indication. As for Niel Andreevich he had become deadly pale.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who," he cried, "who has brought you these tales? Speak! That brigand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark? I am going straight to the Governor. Tatiana Markovna, if this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young man again sets foot in your house, you and I are strangers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Otherwise within twenty four hours, both he and you and your whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>household shall be transferred to a place where not even a raven can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>penetrate with food. Who? Who told him? I will know. Who? Speak," he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hissed, gasping for breath, and hardly knowing what he said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Stop talking rubbish, Niel Andreevich," commanded Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rising suddenly from her place. "You will explode with fury. Better</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drink some water. You ask who has said it. There is no secret about it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for I have said it, and it is common knowledge in the town."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tatiana Markovna!" shrieked Niel Andreevich.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have your deserts. Why make so much noise about it? In another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>person's house you attack a woman, and that is not the action of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gentleman."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How dare you speak like that to me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky would have thrown himself on him if his aunt had not waved him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aside. Then with the commanding dignity she knew how to assume, she put</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on her cap, wrapt herself in her shawl, and went right up to Niel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Andreevich, while Raisky looked on in amazement, with a sense of his own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>smallness in her majestic presence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who are you?" she began. "A clerk in the chancellery, an upstart. And</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yet you dare to address a noblewoman with violence. You have too good an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opinion of yourself, and have asked for your lesson, which you shall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have from me once and for all. Have you forgotten the days when you used</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to bring documents from the office to my father, and did not dare to sit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>down in my presence, when you used to receive gifts from my hand on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feast-days? If you were an honest man no one would reproach you. But you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have, as my nephew says, accumulated stolen wealth, and it has been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>endured out of weakness. You should hold your tongue, and repent in your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old age of your evil life. But you are bursting, intoxicated with pride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sober yourself and bow your head. Before you stands Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Berezhkov, and also my nephew Boris Pavlovich Raisky. If I had not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>restrained him he would have thrown you out of the house, but I prefer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that he should not soil his hands with you; the lackeys are good</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enough."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As she stood there with blazing eyes, she bore a close resemblance to a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>portrait of one of her ancestors that hung on the wall. Tychkov turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his eyes this way and that seemingly beside himself with rage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I shall write to St. Petersburg," he gasped, "the town is in danger."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then he slunk out, so agitated by her furious aspect that he dared not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>raise his eyes to her face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna maintained her proud bearing, though her fingers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grasped nervously at her shawl. Raisky approached her hesitatingly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seeing in her, not his aunt, but another, and to him an almost unknown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I did not understand the majesty of your temperament. But I make my bow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not as a grandson before to an honoured grandmother, but as man to woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I offer you my admiration and respect, Tatiana Markovna, best of women,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he said, kissing her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I accept your courtesy, Boris Pavlovich, as an honour which I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deserved. Do you accept for your honourable championship the kiss, not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of a grandmother, but of a woman."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As she kissed him on the cheek, he received another kiss from the other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>side.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"This kiss is from another woman," said Vera in a low voice as she left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the room, before Raisky's outstretched arms could reach her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera and I have not spoken to one another, but we have both understood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you. We do, in fact, talk very little, but we resemble one another,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Granny, you are an extraordinary woman!" cried Raisky, looking at her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with as much enthusiasm as if he saw her for the first time.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Drive to the Governor's, Borushka, and tell him exactly what has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happened so that the other party may not be first with his lying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nonsense. I am going to beg Paulina Karpovna's pardon."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For three days the impression of this Sunday morning breakfast remained</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with Raisky. He had been surprised by this sudden transformation of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna from grandmother and kindly hostess into a lioness, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he had been still more agitated by Vera's kiss. He could have wept for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>emotion, and would like to have built new hopes on it, but it was a kiss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that led no further, a flash of lightning immediately extinguished.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky kept his promise, and neither went to Vera's room, nor followed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her; he saw her only at meals and then rarely talked to her. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>succeeded in hiding from her the fact that she still occupied his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thoughts; he would like to have wiped out of her recollection his hasty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>revelation of himself to her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then he began a portrait of Tatiana Markovna, and occupied himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seriously with the plan of his novel. With Vera as the central figure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the scene his own estate and the bank of the Volga his fancy took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shape and the secret of artistic creation became clear to him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It chanced once or twice that he found himself walking with Vera. Gaily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and almost indifferently he poured out for her his store of thought and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knowledge, even of anecdote, as he might do to any amiable, clever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stranger, without second thoughts or any wish to reap an advantage. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>led in fact a peaceful, pleasant life, demanding nothing and regretting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing. He perceived with satisfaction that Vera no longer avoided him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that she confided in him and drew closer to him; she would herself come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to his room to fetch books, and he made no effort to retain her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They often spent the afternoon with Tatiana Markovna. Vera apparently</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>liked to hear him talk, and smiled at his jokes, though from time to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time she would get up suddenly in the middle of a sentence when he was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reading aloud or talking, and with some slight excuse, go out and not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appear again for hours. He made no effort to follow her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He found recreation with friends in the town, driving occasionally with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Governor or taking part with Marfinka and Vera in some rural</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>entertainment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The month which Mark had set as a limit for their wager, was nearly over,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Raisky felt himself free from passion. At least he thought so, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>put down all his symptoms to the working of his imagination and to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>curiosity. On some days even Vera appeared to him in the same light as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka. He saw in them two charming young girls, only late left school</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with all the ideas and adorations of the schoolgirl, with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>schoolgirl's dream-theory of life, which is only shattered by experience.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He told himself that he was absolutely cold and indifferent, and in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>position truthfully to call himself her friend. He would shortly leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the place, but before that he must visit "Barabbas," take his last pair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of trousers, and warn him against making a wager.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He went to Leonti to ask where Mark was to be found and discovered them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>both at breakfast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You might develop into a decent individual," cried Mark to him, "if you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were a little bolder."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You mean if I had the boldness to shoot my neighbour or to storm an inn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by night."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How will you take an inn by storm? Besides, there is no need, since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your aunt has her own guesthouse. Many thanks for having chased that old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>swine from your house, I am told in conjunction with Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Splendid!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where did you hear that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The whole town is talking of it. I wanted to come and show my respect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to you, when I suddenly heard that you were on friendly terms with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Governor, had invited him to your house, and that you and your aunt had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stood on your hind paws before him. That is abominable, when I thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you had only invited him to show him the door."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is what is called bourgeois courage, I believe."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't know what it is called, but I can best give you an example of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the kind of courage. For some time the police inspector has been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sniffing round our vegetable garden, so probably his Excellency has been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kind enough to show an interest in me, and to enquire after my health</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and amusements. Well, I am training a couple of bull-dogs, and I hadn't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had them a week before the garden was clear of cats. I have them ready</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at dark, and if the Colonel or his suite arrive, I shall let my beasts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loose. Of course it will happen by accident."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have come to say goodbye, for I am leaving here shortly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are going away?" asked Mark in astonishment, then added in a low,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>serious voice, "I should like to have a word with you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Speak, by all means. Is it a question of money again?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Money as far as I am concerned, but it is not of that I wish to speak</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to you. I will come to you later. I cannot speak of that now," he said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking significantly at Koslov's wife to indicate that he could not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>explain himself in her presence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No one will let you go?" whispered Juliana Andreevna. "I have not once</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spoken to you out of hearing of my husband."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you brought the money with you," asked Mark suddenly, "the three</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hundred roubles for the wager?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is the pair of trousers?" asked Raisky ironically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not joking; you must pay me my three hundred roubles."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why? I am not in love as you see."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I see that you are head over ears in love."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How do you see that."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In your face."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The month is past, and with it the wager at an end. As I don't need the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trousers I will make you a present of them to go with the coat."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How can you go away?" complained Leonti. "And the books--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What books?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your books. See for yourself by the catalogue that they are all right."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have made you a present of them."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Be serious for a moment. Where shall I send them?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Goodbye. I have no time to spare. Don't come to me with the books, or I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will burn them. And you, wise man, who can tell a lover by his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>farewell. I don't know whether we shall meet again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is the money? It isn't honest not to surrender it. I see the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>presence of love, which like measles has not yet come out, but soon will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Your face is already red. How tiresome that I fixed a limit, and so lose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>three hundred roubles by my own stupidity."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Goodbye."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will not go," said Mark with decision.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I shall have another opportunity of seeing you, Koslov. I am not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>starting until next week."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will not go," repeated Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What about your novel?" asked Leonti. "You intended to finish it here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am already near the end of it, though there is still some arranging</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to be done, which I can do in St. Petersburg."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will not end your romance either, neither the paper one nor the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>real one." said Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky was about to answer, but thought better of it, and was quickly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do you think he won't finish the novel?" asked Leonti.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is only half a man," replied Mark with a scornful, bitter laugh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky walked in the direction of home. His victory over himself seemed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so assured that he was ashamed of his earlier weakness. He pictured to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself how he would now appear to her in a new and surprising guise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bold, deliberately scornful, with neither eyes nor desire for her beauty;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and he pictured her astonishment and sorrow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In his impatience to see the effect of this new development in himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he stole into her room and crossed the carpet without betraying his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>presence. She sat with her elbows on the table, reading a letter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>written as he noticed on blue paper in irregular lines and sealed with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>common blackish-brown sealing wax.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera!" he said in a low voice. She shrank back with such obvious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terror that he too trembled, then quickly put the letter in her pocket.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They looked at one another without stirring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are busy. Excuse my coming," he said, and took a step backward, as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if to leave her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She made no answer, but, gradually recovering her self-possession, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without removing her eyes from his face she advanced towards him with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her hand still in her pocket.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It must be a very interesting letter and a great secret," he said with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a forced laugh, "since you conceal it so quickly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>With her eyes still upon him she sat down on the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Show me the letter," he laughed, betraying his agitation by a tremor of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the voice. "You will not show it?" he went on as she looked at him in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>amazement and pressed her hand tighter in her pocket.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't need to read it. What possible interest could I have in another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>person's letter? I only wanted a proof of your confidence, of your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friendly disposition towards me. You see my indifference. See, I am not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as I was," he said, telling himself at the same time that the letter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>obsessed him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She tried, to read in his face the indifference in which he was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>insisting. His face indeed wore an aspect of indifference, but his voice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sounded as if he were pleading for alms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will not show it," he said. "Then God be with you," and he turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait," she said, putting her hand in her pocket and drawing out a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>letter which she showed him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked at both sides, and glanced at the signature, Pauline Kritzki.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is not the letter," he said, returning it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you see another?" she asked drily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He replied that he had not, fearing that she might accuse him of spying,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and at her request began to read:</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ma belle chamante divine Vera Vassilievna! I am enraptured and fall on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my knees before your dear, noble, handsome cousin; he has avenged me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and I am triumphant and weep for joy. He was great. Tell him that he is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ever my knight, that I am his devoted slave. Ah, how I admire him, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would say--the word is on the tip of my tongue--but I dare not. Yet why</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should I not? Yes, I love him, I adore him. Everyone must adore him...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here Raisky attempted to return the letter, but Vera bade him continue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as there was a request for him. He skipped a few lines and proceeded:--</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Implore your cousin (he adores you. Do not deny it, for I have seen his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passionate glances. What would I not give to be in your place).</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Implore your cousin, darling Vera Vassilievna, to paint my portrait. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>don't really care about the portrait, but to be with an artist to admire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him, to speak to him, to breathe the same air with him! _Ma pauvre</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tЙte, je deviens folle. Je compte sur vous, ma belle et bonne amie, et</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>j'attends la rИponse_."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What answer shall I give her?" asked Vera, as Raisky laid the letter on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the table.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He was thinking of the other letter, wondering why she had hidden it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and did not hear her question.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"May I write that you agree?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God forbid! on no account."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How is it to be done then? She wants to breathe the same air as you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I should stifle in that atmosphere."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But if I ask you to do it?" whispered Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You, what difference can it make to you?" he asked trembling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I should like to say something pleasant to her," she returned, but did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not add that she seized this means of detaching him from herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna would not lightly let him out of her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Should you accept it as a sign of friendship if I fulfilled your wish?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Well, then," as she nodded, "I make two conditions, one that you should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be present at the sittings. Otherwise I should be clearing out at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>first sitting. Do you agree?" Then, as she nodded unwillingly, "the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>second is that you show me the other letter."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Which letter?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The one you hid so quickly in your pocket."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There isn't another."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You would not have hidden this letter in terror; will you show the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are beginning again," she said reproachfully.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You need not trouble. I was only jesting. But for God's sake do not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>look on me as a despТt or a spy; it was mere curiosity. God be with you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and your secrets."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have no secrets," she returned drily as he rose to go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you know that I am soon leaving?" he asked suddenly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I heard so; is it true?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do you doubt?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She dropped her eyes and said nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will be glad for me to go?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes," she answered in a whisper.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why," he said sadly, and came nearer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She thought for a moment, drew out another letter, glanced through it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carefully scratching out a word or a line here and there, and handed it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Read that letter," she said, again slipping her hand into her pocket.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He began to read the delicate handwriting: "I am sorry, dear Natasha,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and then asked, "Who is Natasha?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The priest's wife, my school friend."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah! the pope's wife. It is your own letter. That is interesting," and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he became absorbed in the reading.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am sorry, dear Natasha," the letter ran, "that I have not written to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you since my return. As usual I have been idle, but I had other reasons,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which you shall learn. The chief reason you already know (here some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>words were scratched out), which agitates me very much. But of that we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will speak when we meet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The other reason is the arrival of our relative, Boris Pavlovich Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>For my misfortune he scarcely ever leaves the house, so that for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fortnight I did hardly anything except hide from him. What an abundance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of reason, of different kinds of knowledge, of brilliance, of talent he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brought with him, and with it all what unrest. He upsets the whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>household. He had hardly arrived before he was seized with the firm</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conviction that not only the estate, but all that lived on it, were his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>property. Taking his stand on a relationship, which hardly deserves the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>name, and on the fact that he knew us when we were little, he treated us</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as if we were children or schoolgirls. Although I have hidden myself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from him, I have only just succeeded in preventing him from seeing how I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sleep and dream, and what I hope and wait for.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"This pursuit has almost made me ill, and I have seen no one, written to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no one. I feel like a prisoner. It is as if he were playing with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>perhaps quite against his own will. One day he is cold and indifferent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the next his eyes are ablaze, and I fear him as I would a madman. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>worst of all seems to me to be that he does not know himself, so that no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reliance can be placed on his plans and promises; he decides on one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>course, and the next day takes another. He himself says he is nervous,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>susceptible and passionate, and he may be right. He is no play actor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and does not disguise himself; he is, I think, too sensible and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>well-bred, indeed, too honest, for that.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is by way of being an artist, draws, writes, improvises very nicely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the piano, and dreams of art. Yet it seems to me that he does</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>substantially nothing, but is spending his life, as he says, in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>adoration of beauty; he is a lover by temperament, like (do you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remember?) Dashenka Sfemechkin, who fell in love with a Spanish prince,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whose portrait she had seen in a German calendar, and would admit no one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not even the piano-tuner, Kish. But Boris Pavlovich is full of kindness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and honour, is upright, gay, original, but all these qualities are so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>disconnected and uncertain in their expression that we don't know what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to make of them. Now he seeks my friendship, but I am afraid of him, am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afraid he may do anything, am afraid (here some lines were crossed out).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ah, if only he would go away. It is terrible to think he may one day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(here again words were crossed out).</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And I need one thing--rest. The doctor says I am nervous, must spare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>myself, and avoid all agitation. Thank God, he is also attached to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother, and I am left in peace. I do not want to step out of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>circle I have drawn for myself; and nobody else should cross the line.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In its sanctity lies my peace and my whole happiness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If Raisky oversteps this line, the only course that remains to me is to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fly from here. That is easy to say, but where? And then I have some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conscience about it, because he is so good, so kind to me and my sister,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and means to make a gift to us of this place, this Paradise, where I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have learned to live and not to vegetate. It lies on my conscience that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he should squander these undeserved tokens of affection, that he tries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to be brilliant for my sake, and to awaken in me some affection,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>although I have denied him every hope. Ah, if he only knew how vain his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>efforts are.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now I will tell you about _him_...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The letter went no further, and Raisky looked at the lines as if he were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trying to read behind them. Vera had said practically nothing about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself; she remained in the shadow, while the whole garish light fell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There was another letter," he said sharply, "written on blue paper."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera had not left the room, but someone's hand was on the lock.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is there?" asked Raisky with a start.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the doorway appeared Vassilissa's anxious face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It's I," she said in a low voice. "It's a good thing you are here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris Pavlovich; they are asking for you. Please make haste. There is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nobody in the hall. Yakob is at church. Egorka has been sent to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volga for some fish, and I am alone with Pashutka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is asking for me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A gendarme from the Governor. The Governor asks you to go to see him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at once, if possible, if not to-morrow morning. The business is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pressing."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Very well. I will go."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Please, as quickly as possible. Then _he_ has also come."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The man they would like to horsewhip. He has made himself at home in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the hall, and is waiting for you. The Mistress and Marfa Vassilievna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have not yet returned from the town."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Didn't you ask his name?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He gave his name, but I have forgotten. He is the man who stayed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>night with you when you were drinking. Please, Boris Pavlovich, be quick.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pashutka and I have locked ourselves in."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because we were afraid. I climbed out of the window into the yard to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come and tell you. If only he does not nose anything out."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went with her, laughing. He sent a message by the gendarme that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he would be with the Governor in an hour. Then he sought out Mark and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>led him into his room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you wish to spend the night with me?" he asked ironically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am indeed a nightbird," answered Mark, who looked anxious. "I receive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>too much attention in the daytime, and it puts less shame on your Aunt's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house. The magnificent old lady, to show Tychkov the door. But I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come to you on important business," he said, looking serious.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have business! That is interesting."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, more serious than yours. To-day I was at the police-station, not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exactly paying a call. The police inspector had invited me, and I was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>politely fetched with a pair of grey horses."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What has happened?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A trifling thing. I had lent books to one or two people...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Perhaps mine, that you had taken from Leonti?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Those and others--here is the list," he said, handing him a slip of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>paper.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To whom did you give the books?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To many people, mostly young people. One fool, the son of an advocate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not understand some French phrases, and showed the book to his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mother, who handed it on to the father, and he in his turn to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>magistrate. The magistrate, having heard of the name of the author, made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a great commotion and informed the Governor. At first the lad would not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>give me away, but when they applied the rod to him he gave my name, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-day they summoned me to court."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And what line did you adopt?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What line?" said Mark laughing, as he looked at Raisky. "They asked me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whose books they were, and where I had got them, and I said from you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some you had brought with you; others, Voltaire, for instance, I had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>found in your library."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I'm much obliged. Why did you put this honour on me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nobody will meddle with you, since you are in his Excellency's favour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then you are not living here under official compulsion. But I shall be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sent off to a third place of exile; this is already the second. At any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other time this would be a matter of indifference to me, but just now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the time being, at least, I should like to stay here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And what else?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nothing. I only wanted to tell you what I have done, and to ask whether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you will take it on yourself or not."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But what if I won't, and I don't intend to."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then instead of your name I will give Koslov's. He is growing mouldy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here. Let him go to prison. He can take up his Greeks again later."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, he will never take them up again if he is robbed of his position,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and of his bread and butter."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There you are right, my conclusions were illogical. It would be better</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for you to take it on yourself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are you to me that I should do so?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"On the former occasion I needed money, and you had what I lacked. This</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is the same case. No one will touch you, while I should be sent off. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>am now logical enough."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You ask a remarkable service. I am just going to the Governor, who has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sent for me. Good-bye."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He has sent for you, then?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What am I to do? What should I say?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Say that you are the hero of the piece, and the Governor will quash the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole matter, for he does not like sending special reports to St.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Petersburg. With me it is quite different. I am under police supervision,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and it is his duty to return a report every month as to my circumstances</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and my mode of life. However," he added with apparent indifference, "do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as you like. And now come, for I have no more time either. Let us go as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>far as the wood together, and I will climb down the precipice. I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wait at the fisherman's on the island to see how the matter ends."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At the edge of the precipice Mark vanished into the bushes. Raisky drove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the Governor's, and returned home about two o'clock in the morning.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Although he had gone so late to bed, he rose early. The windows of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's room were still darkened. She is still sleeping, he thought, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he went into the garden, where he walked up and down for an hour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>waiting for the drawing back of the lilac curtain. He hoped Marina would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cross the yard, but she did not come. Then Tatiana Markovna's window was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opened, the pigeons and the sparrows began to gather on the spot were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they were wont to receive crumbs from Marfinka, doors opened and shut,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the grooms and the servants crossed the yard, but the lilac curtain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remained untouched. The gloomy Savili came out of his room and looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silently round the yard. When Raisky called him he came towards him with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slow steps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tell Marina to let me know when Vera Vassilievna is dressed."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marina is not here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is she?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She started at dawn to accompany the young lady over the Volga."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What young lady, Vera Vassilievna?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How did they go, and with whom?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In the _brichka_, with the dun horse. They will return in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>evening," he added.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you think they will return to-day?" asked Raisky with interest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Assuredly. Prokor with the horse, and Marina too. They will see the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young lady safely there, and return immediately."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky looked at Savili without seeing him, and they stood opposite one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another for some time speechless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you any further orders?" Savili asked at length.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky recovered himself, and inquired whether Savili was awaiting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina. Savili replied by a curse on his wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do you beat her?" asked Raisky. "I have been intending for a long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time to advise you to leave her alone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't beat her any more."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Since when?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For the last week, since she has stayed quietly at home."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go, I have no orders. But do not beat Marina. It will be better both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for you and her if you give her complete liberty."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky passed on his way with bent head, glancing sadly at Vera's window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Savili's eyes too were on the ground, and he had forgotten to put his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cap on again in his amazement at Raisky's last words.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Passion once more!" thought Raisky. "Alas, for Savili, and for me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Since Vera's departure Raisky had experienced the meaning of unmitigated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>solitude. He felt as if he were surrounded by a desert, now that he was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deprived of the sight of her, although nature around him was radiant and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>smiling. Tatiana Markovna's anxious solicitude, Marfinka's charming rule,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her songs, her lively chatter with the gay and youthful Vikentev, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arrival and departure of guests, the eccentricities of the freakish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna--none of these things existed for him. He only saw that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the lilac curtain was motionless, the blinds had been drawn down, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that Vera's favourite bench remained empty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He did not want to love Vera, and if he had wished it he ought still to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>resist, for Vera had denied him every hope; indeed her beauty seemed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have lost its power over him, and he was now drawn to her by a different</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>attraction.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is Vera's real nature?" he asked his aunt one day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You see for yourself. She recognises only her own understanding and her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>own will. She was born in my arms, and has spent her whole life with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yet I do not know what is in her mind, what are her likes and dislikes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I do not force her, or worry her, so that she can hardly think herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unfortunate. You see for yourself that my girls live with me as free as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the birds of the air."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are right, Grandmother. It is not fear, or anxiety, or the power of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>authority that binds you to them, but the tenderest of home ties. They</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>adore you, and so they ought to do, but it is the fruit of their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>upbringing. Why should worn-out conceptions of duty be pressed upon them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and why should they live like caged birds? Let them dip into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reservoir of life itself. A bird imprisoned in a cage loses the capacity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for freedom, and, even if the door of his cage is opened, he will not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>take flight."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have never tried to exercise restraint on Marfinka or Vera. Supposing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a respectable, rich man of old and blameless family were to ask for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's hand, and she refused it, do you think I should persuade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, Granny, I leave Marfinka to you, but do not attempt to do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anything with Vera. You must not restrain her in any way, must leave her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her freedom. One bird is born for the cage, another for freedom. Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will be able to direct her own life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do I restrain or repress her? I am like the police inspector who only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sees that there is an outward semblance of order; I do not penetrate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>below the surface unless my assistance is invited."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tell me, Grandmother, what sort of a woman is this priest's wife, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what are the links that bind her to Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Natalie Ivanovna and Vera made friends at a boarding school. She is a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>good, modest woman."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is she sensible? Possibly a woman of weight and character?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh no! She is not stupid, is fairly educated, a great reader, and fond</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of dress. The pope, who is much liked by the local landowner, is not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>poor, and lives in comfort on his own land. He is a sensible man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>belongs to the younger generation, but he leads too worldly a life for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the priesthood, as is the custom in landed society. He reads French</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books, and smokes, for instance; things that are unsuited to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>priestly garb. Every glance of Veroshka's, every mood of hers is sacred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Natalie Ivanovna; whatever she may say is wise and good. This suits</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera, who does not want a friend, but an obedient servant; that is why</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she loves the pope's wife."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And Vera loves you too?" asked Raisky, who wanted to know if Vera loved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anybody else except the pope's wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, she loves me," answered Tatiana Markovna with conviction, "but in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her own fashion. She never shows it, and never will, though she loves me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and would be ready to die for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you love Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, how I love her!" she sighed, and tears stood in her eyes. "She does</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not know, but perhaps one day she may learn."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you noticed how thoughtful she has been for some time. Is she not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in love?" he added in a half-whisper, but immediately regretted the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>question, which it was too late to withdraw. His aunt started back as if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a stone had hit her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God forbid!" she cried, making the sign of the Cross. "This sorrow has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been spared us. Do not disturb my peace, but confess, as you would to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the priest, if you know anything."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky was annoyed with himself, and made an effort, partially</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>successful, to pacify his aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have not noticed anything more than you have. She would hardly be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>likely to say anything to me that she kept secret from you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, yes, it is true she will say nothing. The pope's wife knows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everything, but she would rather die than betray Vera's secrets. Her own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>secrets she scatters for anyone to pick up, but not Vera's."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"With whom could she fall in love?" remarked Tatiana Markovna after a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silence. "There is no one here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No one?" interrupted Raisky quickly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna shook her head, then went on after a while:--</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There might be the Forester. He is an excellent individual, and has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shown an inclination, I notice. He would be certainly an admirable match</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for Vera, but...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She is so strange. Heaven knows how any one would dare, how any man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would woo her. He is splendid--well-established and rich. The wood alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yields thousands."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is the Forester young, educated, a man that counts?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa entered and announced Paulina Karpovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The evil one himself has brought her," grumbled Tatiana Markovna. "Show</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her in, and be quick with breakfast."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>One evening a thunderstorm was brewing. The black clouds lay entrenched</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beyond the Volga, and the air was as hot and moist as in a bath-house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here and there over the fields and roads rose pillars of dust.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the house Tatiana Markovna sent her household hurrying to close the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stove pipes, the doors and the windows. She was not only afraid of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thunderstorm herself, but she was not pleased if her fear was not shared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by everybody else--that would be freethinking. So at each flash of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lightning everyone must make the sign of the Cross, on pain of being</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought a blockhead. She chased Egorka from the ante-room into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>servants' room, because during the approach of the storm he would not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stop giggling with the maids.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The storm approached majestically, with the dull distant noise of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thunder, with a storm of sand, when suddenly there was a flash of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lightning over the village and a sharp clap of thunder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Disregarding the passionate warnings of his aunt, Raisky took his cap</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and umbrella and hurried into the park, anxious to see the landscape</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>under the shadow of the storm, to find new ideas for his drawings, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to observe his own emotions. He descended the cliff, and passed through</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the undergrowth by a winding, hardly perceptible path. The rain fell by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bucketfuls, one flash of lightning followed another, the thunder rolled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the whole prospect was veiled in mist and cloud. He soon regretted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his intention. His soaked umbrella did not protect him from the rain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which whipped his face and poured down on his clothes, and his feet sank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ankle-deep in the muddy ground. He was continually knocking against and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stumbling over unevennesses in the ground or tree stumps, treading in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>holes and pools. He was obliged to stand still until a flash of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lightning lighted up a few yards of the path. He knew that not far away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lay a ruined arbour, dating from the time when the precipice formed part</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the garden. Not long before he had seen it in the thicket, but now it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was indiscoverable, however much he would have preferred to observe the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>storm from its shelter. And since he did not wish to retrace the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>horrible path by which he had come, he resolved to make his way to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nearest carriage road, to climb over the twisted hedge and to reach the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>village.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He could hardly drag his soaked boots free of the mud and weeds, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was dazzled by the lightning and nearly deafened by the noise. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>confessed that he might as well have admired the storm from the shelter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the house. In the end he struck the fence, but when he tried to leap</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over it he slipped and fell in the ditch. With difficulty he dragged</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself out and clambered over. There was little traffic on the steep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and dangerous ridge, used for the most part as a short cut by empty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one-horse carriages with their quiet beasts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He closed his dripping umbrella, and put it under his arm. Dazzled by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the lightning, slipping every minute, he toiled painfully up the slope,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and when he reached the summit he heard close by the noise of wheels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the neighing of horses and the cry of the coachman. He stood on one side</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and pressed himself against the fence to allow the passage of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carriage, since the road was very narrow. In a flash of lightning Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saw before him a char-Ю-banc with several persons in it, drawn by two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>well-kept, apparently magnificent horses. In the light of another flash</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he was amazed to recognise Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera," he cried loudly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The carriage stood still.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is there? Is it you, cousin, in this weather?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am hurrying home."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So do I want to. I came down the precipice, and lost my way in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bushes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is driving you? Is there room for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Plenty of room," said a masculine voice. "Give me your hand to get up."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky gave his hand, and was hauled up by a strong arm. Next to Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sat Marina, and the two, huddled together like wet chickens, were trying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to protect themselves from the drenching rain by the leather covering.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is with you?" asked Raisky in a low voice. "Whose horses are these,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and who is driving?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ivan Ivanovich."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't know him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The Forester," whispered Vera, and he would have repeated her words if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had not nudged him to keep silence. "Later," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He remembered the talk with his aunt, her praises of the Forester, her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hints of his being a good match. This then was the hero of the romance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Forester. He tried to get a look at him, but only saw an ordinary</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hat with a wide brim, and a tall, broad-shouldered figure wrapped in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rain coat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Forester handled the reins skilfully as he drove up the steep hill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cracked his whip, whistled, held the horses' heads with a firm hand when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they threatened to shy at a flash of lightning, and turned round to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>those sheltered in the body of the vehicle.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How do you feel, Vera Vassilievna," he inquired anxiously. "Are you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>very cold and wet?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am quite comfortable, Ivan Ivanovich; the rain does not catch me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must take my raincoat. God forbid that you should take cold. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should never forgive myself all my life for having driven you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You weary me with your friendly anxiety. Don't bother about anything</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but your horses."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As you please," replied Ivan Ivanovich with hasty obedience, turning to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his horses, and he cast only an occasional anxious glance towards Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They drove past the village to the door of the new house. Ivan Ivanovich</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>jumped down and hammered on the door with his riding whip. Handing over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the care of his horses to Prokor, Tarasska and Egorka, who hurried up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the purpose, he stood by the steps, took Vera in his arms, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carried her carefully and respectfully, like a precious burden, through</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the ranks of wide-eyed lackeys and maid-servants bearing lights, to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>divan in the hall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky followed, wet and dirty, without once removing his eyes from them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Forester went back into the ante-room, made himself as respectable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as he could, shook himself, pushed his fingers through his hair, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>demanded a brush.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Meanwhile Tatiana Markovna bade Vera welcome and reproached her for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>venturing on such a journey; she must change her clothes throughout and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in a few moments the samovar would be brought in, and supper served.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Quick, quick, Grandmother!" said Vera, rubbing herself affectionately</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>against her. "Let us have tea, soup, roast and wine. Ivan Ivanovich is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hungry." She knew how to quiet her aunt's anxiety.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That's splendid. It shall be served in a minute. Where is Ivan</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivanovich?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am making myself a bit decent," cried a voice from the ante-room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Egor, Yakob and Stepan hummed round the Forester as if he had been a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>good horse. Then he entered the hall and respectfully kissed the hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Tatiana Markovna, and of Marfinka, who had only just decided to get</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out of bed, where she had hidden herself for fear of the storm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is not necessary, Marfinka," said her aunt, "to hide from the storm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You should pray to God, and will not then be struck."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not afraid of thunder and lightning, of which the peasants are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>usually the victims, but it makes me nervous," replied Marfinka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, with the water still dripping off him, stood in the window</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>watching the guest. Ivan Ivanovich Tushin was a tall, broad-shouldered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>man of thirty-eight, with strongly-marked features, a dark, thick beard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and large grey rather timid eyes, and hands disproportionately large,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with broad nails. He wore a grey coat and a high-buttoned vest, with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>broad turned-down home-spun collar. He was a fine man, but with marked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>simplicity, not to put a fine point on it in his glance and his manners.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky wondered jealously whether he was Vera's hero. Why not? Women</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like these tall men with open faces and highly developed muscular</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength. But Vera--</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you, Borushka," cried Tatiana Markovna suddenly, clapping her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Look at your clothes. Egorka and the rest of you! Where are you? There</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is a pool on the floor round you, Borushka. You will be ill. Vera was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>driving home, but there was no reason for you to go out into the storm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Go and change your clothes, Borushka, and have some rum in your tea.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivan Ivanovich, you ought to go with him. Are you acquainted? My nephew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris Raisky--Ivan Ivanovich Tushin."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We have already made acquaintance," said Tushin, with a bow. "We picked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up your nephew on the way. Many thanks, I need nothing, but you, Boris</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pavlovich, ought to change."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must forgive an old woman for telling you you are all half mad. No</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>animal leaves his hole in weather like this. Yakob, shut the shutters</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>closer. Fancy crossing the Volga in weather like this."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My carriage is solid, and has a cover. Vera Vassilievna sat as dry as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if she were in a room."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But in this terrible storm."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Only old women are afraid of a storm."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I'm much obliged."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I beg your pardon," said Tushin in embarrassment. "It slipped from my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tongue. I meant ordinary women."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God will forgive you," laughed Tatiana Markovna. "It won't indeed hurt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you, but Vera! Were you not afraid?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"One does not think of fear with Ivan Ivanovich."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If Ivan Ivanovich went bear-hunting, would you go with him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Grandmother. Take me with you sometimes, Ivan Ivanovich."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"With pleasure, Vera Vassilievna, in winter. You have only to command."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is just like her, not to mind what her Grandmother thinks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was joking, Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I know you would be equal to it. Had you no scruples about hindering</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivan Ivanovich; this distance...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is my fault. As soon as I heard from Natalie Ivanovna that Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna wanted to come home, I asked for the pleasure," he said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking at Vera with a mixed air of modesty and respect.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A nice pleasure in this weather."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It was lighter while we were driving, and Vera Vassilievna was not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afraid."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is Anna Ivanovna well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank you. She sends her kindest regards, and has sent you some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>preserves, also some peaches out of the orangery, and mushrooms. They</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are in the char-Ю-banc."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is very good of her. We have no peaches. I have put aside for her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some of the tea that Borushka brought with him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Many thanks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How could you let your horses climb the hill in such weather? Were they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terrified by the storm?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My horses obey me like dogs. Should I have driven Vera Vassilievna if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there were any danger?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are a good friend," interrupted Vera. "I have absolute trust both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in you, and in your horses."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At this moment Raisky returned, having changed his clothes. He had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>noticed the glance which Vera gave Tushin, and had heard her last remark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank you, Vera Vassilievna," answered Tushin. "Don't forget what you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have just said. If you ever need anything, if...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If there is another such raging storm," said Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Any storm," added Tushin firmly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There are other storms in life," said Tatiana Markovna with a sigh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Whatever they are, if they break on you, Vera Vassilievna, seek refuge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the forest over the Volga, where lives a bear who will serve you, as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the fairytale tells."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will remember," returned Vera laughing. "If a sorcerer wants to carry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me off, as in the fairy-tale, I will take refuge in the wood."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky saw Tushin's glance of devotion and modest reserve, he heard his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>words, so quietly and modestly spoken, and thought the letter written on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the blue paper could be from no one else. He looked at Vera to see if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she were moved or would relapse into a stony silence, but she showed no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sign. Vera appeared to him in a new light. In her manner and her words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Tushin he saw simplicity, trust, gentleness and affection such as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>showed to no one else, not even to her aunt or to Marfinka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She is on her guard with her Grandmother," he thought, "and takes no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heed of Marfinka. But when she looks at Tushin, speaks to him, or gives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her hand it is plain to see that they are friends."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Forester, who had business to do in the town, stayed for three days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with Tatiana Markovna, and for three days Raisky sought for the key to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this new character and to his place in Vera's heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They called Ivan Ivanovich the "Forester," because he lived on his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>estate in the midst of the forest. He loved the forest, growing new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>timber on the one hand and on the other allowing it to be cut down and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loaded up on the Volga for sale. The several thousand _dessiatins_</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of surrounding forest were exceedingly well managed, and nothing was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lacking; there was even a steam saw. He attended to everything himself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and in his spare time hunted and fished and amused himself with his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bachelor neighbours. From time to time he sought a change of scene, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then arranged with his friends to drive in a three-horse carriage, drawn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by fresh horses, forty versts away to the seat of a landed proprietor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where for three days the fun was fast enough. Then they returned, put up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with Tushin, or waked the sleepy town. In these festivals all class</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>distinctions were lost.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After this dissipation he would again remain lost to the world for three</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>months in his forest home, see after the wood cutting, and go hunting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with two servants, and occasionally have to lie up with a wounded arm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The life suited him. He read works on agriculture and forestry, took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>counsel with his German assistant, an experienced forester, who was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nevertheless not allowed to be the master. All orders must come from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin himself, and were carried out by the help of two foremen and a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gang of hired labourers. In his spare time he liked to read French</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>novels, the only distraction that he permitted himself. There was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing extraordinary in a retired life like this in the wide district</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in which he lived.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky learnt that Tushin saw Vera at the pope's house, that he went</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there expressly when he heard that Vera was a visitor. Vera herself told</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him so. She and Natalie Ivanovna, too, visited Tushin's property, known</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as "Smoke," because far away from the hills could be seen the smoke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rising from the chimneys of the house in the depth of the forest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin lived with his spinster sister, Anna Ivanovna, to whom Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna was much attached. Tatiana Markovna was delighted when she came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to town. There was no one with whom she liked more to drink coffee, no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one to whom she gave her confidence in the same degree; they shared the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>same liking for household management, the same deep-rooted self-esteem</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the same respect for family tradition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Of Tushin himself there was little more to say than was revealed on a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>first occasion; his character lay bare to the daylight, with no secret,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no romantic side. He possessed more than plain good sense, for his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understanding did not derive from the brain alone, but from the heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and will. Men of his type, especially when they care nothing for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>superfluous things of life, but keep their eyes fixed undeviatingly on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the necessary, do not make themselves noticed in the crowd and rarely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reach the front of the world's stage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky noticed in the Forester's behaviour towards Vera a constant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>adoration expressed by his glance and his voice, and sometimes by his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>timidity; on her side an equally constant confidence, frankness and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affection, nothing more. He did not surprise in her a single sign or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gesture, a single word or glance that might have betrayed her. Tushin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>showed pure esteem and a consistent readiness to serve her as her bear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and no more. Surely he was not the man who wrote the letter on the blue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>paper.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After the Forester had taken his leave, the household fell back into its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>regular routine. Vera seemed untroubled and in possession of a quiet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness, and showed herself kind and affectionate to her aunt and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka. Yet there were days when unrest suddenly came upon her, when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she went hastily to her room in the old house, or descended the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice into the park, and displayed a gloomy resentment if Raisky or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka ventured to disturb her solitude. After a short interval she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>resumed an even, sympathetic temper, helped in the household, looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over her aunt's accounts, and even paid visits to the ladies in the town.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She discussed literary questions with Raisky, who realised from the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opinions she expressed that her reading was wide and enticed her into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thorough-going discussions. They read together, though not regularly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sometimes a wild intoxication flared up in her, but it was a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>disconcerting merriment. One evening, when she suddenly left the room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna and Raisky exchanged a long questioning glance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you think of Vera?" she began. "She seems to have recovered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from her malady of the soul."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I think it is more serious than before."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the matter with you, Borushka? You can see how gay and friendly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she has become."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is she like the Vera you have known. I fear that this is not gladness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but rather agitation, even intoxication."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are right. She is changed."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't you notice that she is ecstatic?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ecstatic?" repeated Tatiana Markovna anxiously. "Why do you say that,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>especially just at night? I shan't sleep. The ecstasy of a young girl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spells disaster."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Not only Raisky, but Tatiana Markovna gave up her attitude of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>acquiescence, and secretly began to watch Vera narrowly. Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna became thoughtful, she even neglected the affairs of the house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and farm, left the keys lying on the table, did not speak to Savili,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kept no accounts, and did not drive out into the fields. She grew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>melancholy as she sought in vain how she might seek from Vera a frank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>avowal, or find means to avert misfortune.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera in love, in an ecstasy! It seemed to her more than small-pox or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>measles, worse even than brain fever. And with whom was she in love? God</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grant that it were Ivan Ivanovich. If Vera were married to him, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself would die in peace. But her feminine instinct told her that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whatever deep affection the Forester cherished for Vera, it was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reciprocated by nothing more than friendship.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Who then was the man? Of the neighbouring landowners there was only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin whom she saw and knew anything of. The young men in the town, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>officers and councillors, had long since given up any hope of being</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>received into her favour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked keenly and suspiciously at Vera when she came to dinner or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tea, and tried to follow her into the garden, but as soon as Vera was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aware of her aunt's presence she quickened her steps and vanished into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the distance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Spirited away like a ghost!" said Tatiana Markovna to Raisky. "I wanted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to follow her, but where, with my old limbs? She flits like a bird into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the woods, into the bushes, over the precipice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went immediately into the park, where he met Yakob, and asked him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if he had seen the young lady.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I saw Vera Vassilievna just now by the chapel."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What was she doing there?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Praying."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went to the chapel, wondering to himself how she had come to take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>refuge in prayer. On the left there lay in the meadow between the park</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the road, a lonely, weather-beaten, half-ruined wooden chapel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>adorned with a picture of the Christ, a Byzantine painting in a bronze</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>frame. The ikon had grown dark with age, the paint had been cracked in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>many places, so that the Christ face was hardly recognisable, but the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyelids were still plainly discernible, and the eyes looked out dreamily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the worshippers; the folded hands were also preserved.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky advanced noiselessly over the grass. Vera was standing with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back to him, her face turned towards the ikon, unconscious of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>approach. On the grass by the chapel lay her straw hat and sunshade. Her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hands did not make the sign of the Cross, her lips uttered no prayers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her whole body appeared motionless, as if she hardly breathed; her whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>being was at prayer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Involuntarily Raisky too held his breath. Is she begging for happiness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or is she confiding her sorrow to the Crucified?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Suddenly she awoke from her prayer, turned and started when she caught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sight of Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are you doing here?" she said severely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Yakob met me and said you were here; so I came. Grandmother...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Since you mention Grandmother, I will point out that she has been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>watching me for some time. Do you know the reason?" she asked, looking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>straight into his eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I think she always does."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, it was not her idea to watch me. Tell me without concealing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anything, have you communicated to her your suppositions about love and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a letter written on blue paper?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I think not of the letter."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then of love. I must know what you said?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We were speaking of you. Grandmother has her own questionings as to why</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you are so serious one moment and so gay the next. I said (it is a long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time ago) that perhaps you were in love."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And Grandmother?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She was terrified."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Chiefly because of your evident excitement."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother's peace of mind is dear to me; dearer, perhaps, than you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>think."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She told me herself that she believed in your boundless love for her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank God! I am grateful to you for repeating this to me. Go to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother and destroy this curiosity of hers about my being in love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in ecstasy. It cannot be difficult for you, and you will fulfil my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wishes if you love me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What would I not do to prove it to you. Later in the evening...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, this minute. When I come to dinner her eyes are to look on me as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before, do you understand?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, I will go!" promised Raisky, but did not stir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Make haste!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For answer she pointed in the direction of the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"One word more," she said, detaining him. "You must never, never talk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about me to Grandmother, do you understand?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Agreed, sister."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She motioned him to be gone, and when turning into an avenue he looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>round for a moment, she had vanished. She had, as Grandmother said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>disappeared like a ghost. A moment later there was the report of a gun</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from the precipice. Raisky wondered who was playing tricks there, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went towards the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera appeared punctually at the midday meal. Keenly as he looked at her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky could observe no change in her. Tatiana Markovna glanced at him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>once or twice in inquiry, but was visibly reassured when she saw no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>signs of anything unusual. Raisky had executed Vera's commission, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had alleviated her acutest anxiety, but it was impossible to reassure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her completely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna was saddened and wounded by the lack of confidence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shown her by Vera, her niece, her daughter, her dearest child, entrusted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to her care by her mother. Terror overcame her. She lay awake anxiously</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through the night, she questioned Marina, sent Marfinka to find out what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera was doing, but without result. Suddenly there occurred to her what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seemed to her a good plan; as she put it to Raisky, she would make use</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of allegory. She remembered that she possessed a moral tale which she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had read and wept over in her own youth. Its theme was the disastrous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consequences which followed on passion and disobedience to parents. A</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>young man and a girl loved one another, and met against the will of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their parents. She stood on the balcony beckoning and talking to him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and they wrote one another long epistles. Others intervened, the young</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>girl lost her reputation, and the young man was sent to some vague place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in America by his father.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Like many others Tatiana Markovna pinned her faith to the printed word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>especially when the reading was of an edifying character. So she took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her talisman from the shelf, where it lay hidden under a pile of rubbish,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and laid it on the table near her work basket. At dinner she declared to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the two sisters her desire that they should read aloud to her on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alternate evenings, especially in bad weather, since she could not read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>very much on account of her eyes. Generally speaking, she was not an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enthusiastic reader, and only liked to listen when Tiet Nikonich read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aloud to her on agricultural matters or hygiene, or about distressing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>occurrences of murder or arson.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera said nothing, but Marfinka asked immediately whether the book had a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happy ending.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What sort of book is it?" inquired Raisky, picking up the book and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glancing at a page here and there. "What old rubbish have you discovered,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother. I expect you read it when you were in love with Tiet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikonich."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't be foolish, Boris Pavlovich. You are not asked to read."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky took his departure, and the room was left to the reading party.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera was unendurably bored, but she never refused assent to any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>definitely expressed wish of her aunt's. At last, after three or four</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>evenings, the point was reached where the lovers exchanged their vows.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The tale was faultlessly moral and horribly dull. Vera hardly listened.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At each word of love her aunt looked at her to see whether she was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>touched, whether she blushed or turned pale, but Vera merely yawned.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On the last evening when only a few chapters were left, Raisky stayed in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the room when the table was cleared and the reading began. Vikentev, too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was present. He could not sit quiet, but jumped up from time to time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ran to Marfinka, and begged to be allowed to take his share in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reading. When they gave him the book he inserted long tirades of his own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the novel, or read with a different voice suited to each character.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He made the heroine lisp in a mournful whisper, the hero speak with his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>own natural voice, so that Marfinka blushed and looked angrily at him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the stern father spoke with the voice of Niel Andreevich. At last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna took the book from him with an intimation to him to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behave reasonably, whereupon he continued his studies in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>character-mimicry for Marfinka's benefit behind her back. When Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>betrayed him he was requested to go into the garden until supper time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the reading went on without him. The catastrophe of the tale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>approached at last, and when the last word was read and the book shut</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there was silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What stupid nonsense," said Raisky at length, and Marfinka wiped away a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you think, Veroshka?" asked Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera made no reply, but Marfinka decided it was a horrid book because</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the lovers had suffered so cruelly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If they had followed the advice of their parents, things would not have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>come to such a pass. What do you think, Veroshka?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera got up to go, but on the threshold she stopped.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother," she said, "why have you bothered me for a whole week with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this stupid book?" And without waiting for an answer she glided away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but Tatiana Markovna called her back.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why, Vera, I meant to give you pleasure."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, you wanted to punish me for something. In future I would rather be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>put for a week on bread and water," and kneeling on the footstool at her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aunt's feet she added, "Good-night, Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna stooped to kiss her and whispered. "I did not want to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>punish you, but to guard you against getting into trouble yourself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And if I do," whispered Vera in reply, "will you have me put in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>convent like Cunigunde?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you think I am a monster like those bad parents? It's wicked, Vera,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to think such things of me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I know it would be wicked, Grandmother, and I don't think any such</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thing. But why warn me with such a silly book?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should I warn you and guard you, my dear. Tell me and set my mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at rest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Make the sign of the Cross over me," she said after a moment's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hesitation, and when her aunt had made the holy sign, Vera kissed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hand and left the room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A wise book," laughed Raisky. "Well, has the beautiful Cunigunde's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>example done any good?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna was grieved and in no mood for joking, and sent for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pashutka to take the book to the servants' room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have brought Vera up in the right way," said Raisky. "Let Egorka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Marina read your allegory together, and the household will be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>impeccable."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>*        *        *        *       *</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vikentev called Marfinka into the garden, Raisky went to his room, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna sat for a long time on the divan, absorbed in thought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She had lost all interest in the book, was herself sickened by its pious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tone, and was really ashamed of having had recourse to so gross a method.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina, Yakob and Vassilissa came one after another to say that supper</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was ready, but Tatiana Markovna wanted none, Vera declined, and to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina's astonishment even Marfinka, who never went supperless to bed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was not hungry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Meanwhile Egorka had got wind of the universal loss of appetite. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>helped himself to a considerable slice from the dish with his fingers to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>taste, as he told Yakob, whom he invited to share the feast. Yakob shook</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his head and crossed himself, but nevertheless did his share, so that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when Marina came to clear the table the fish and the sweets were gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The mistress's preparations for rest were made, and quiet reigned in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house. Tatiana Markovna rose from the divan and looked at the ikon. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crossed herself, but she was too restless for prayer, and did not kneel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>down as usual. Instead she sat down on the bed and began to go over her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passage of arms with Vera. How could she learn what lay on the girl's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart. She remembered the proverb that wisdom comes with the morning,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and lay down, but not that night to sleep, for there was a light tap on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the door, and she heard Marfinka's voice, "Open the door. Grandmother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It's me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What's the matter, my dear?" she said, as she opened the door. "Have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you come to say good-night. God bless you! Where is Nikolai Andreevich?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But she was terrified when she saw Marfinka's face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Sit down in the armchair," she said, but Marfinka clung to her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Lie down, Grandmother, and I will sit on the bed beside you. I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell you everything, but please put out the light."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then Marfinka began to relate how she had gone with Vikentev into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>park to hear the nightingales sing, how she had first objected because</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it was so dark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you afraid?" Vikentev had asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not with you," and they had gone on hand in hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How dark it is! I won't go any farther. Don't take hold of my hand!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She went on involuntarily, although Vikentev had loosed her hand, her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart beating faster and faster. "I am afraid, I won't go a step</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>farther." She drew closer to him all the same, terrified by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crackling of the twigs under her feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here we will wait. Listen!" he whispered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The nightingale sang, and Marfinka felt herself enveloped in the warm</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breath of night. At intervals her hand sought Vikentev's, but when he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>touched hers she drew it back.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How lovely, Marfa Vassilievna! What an enchanted night!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She nudged him not to disturb the song.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Marfa Vassilievna," he whispered, "something so good, so wonderful is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happening to me, something I have never felt before. It is as if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everything in me was astir. At this moment," he went on as she remained</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silent, "I should like to fling myself on horseback, and ride, ride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>till I had no breathe left, or fling myself into the Volga and swim to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the opposite bank. Do you feel anything like that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let us go away from here. Grandmother will be angry."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Just a minute more. How the nightingale does sing! What does he sing?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Just what I should like to say to you, but don't know how to say."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How do you know what he sings? Can you speak nightingale language?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is singing of love, of my love for you," and startled by his own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>words he drew her hand to his lips and covered it with kisses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She drew it back, and ran at full speed down the avenue towards the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house; on the steps she waited a moment to take breath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not a step farther," she cried breathlessly, clinging to the doorpost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as he overtook her. "Go home."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Listen, Marfa Vassilievna, my angel," he cried, falling on his knees.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"On my knees I swear...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you speak another word, I go straight to Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He rose, and led her by force into the avenue.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are you doing? I will call, I won't listen to your nightingale."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You won't listen to it, but you will to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let me go. I will tell Grandmother everything."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must tell her to-night, Marfa Vassilievna. We have come too near to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one another that if we were suddenly separated.... Should you like that,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfa Vassilievna? If you like I will go away for good."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She wept and seized his hand in panic, when he drew back a step.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You love me, you love me," he cried.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does your mother know what you are saying to me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ought you to say it then? Is it honourable?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I shall tell her to-morrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What if she will not give her blessing?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I won't obey."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But I will. I will take no step without your Mother's and Grandmother's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consent," she said, turning to go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As far as I am concerned, I am sure of my Mother's consent. I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hurry now to Kolchino, and my Mother will send you her consent to-morrow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfa Vassilievna, give me your hand."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What will Grandmother say? If she does not forgive me I shall die of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shame," she said, and she hurried into the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Heavens, what will Grandmother say?" she wondered, shutting herself up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in her room, and shaking with fever. How should she tell her grandmother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and should she tell Veroshka first. She decided in favour of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grandmother, and when the house was quiet slipped to her room like a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mouse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The two talked low to one another for a long time. Tatiana Markovna made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sign of the cross over her darling many times, until she fell asleep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on her shoulder. Then she carefully laid the girl's head on the pillow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rose, and prayed with many tears. But more heartily than for Marfinka's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness she prayed for Vera, with her grey head bowed before the cross.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XVII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vikentev kept his word, and on the very next day brought his mother to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna, he himself taking refuge in his office, where he sat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on pins and needles.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His mother, still a young woman, not much over forty, as gay and full of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>life as he himself was, had plenty of practical sense. They kept up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>between themselves a constant comic war of words; they were for ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>disputing about trifles, but when it came to serious matters, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>proclaimed her authority to him with quite another voice and another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>manner. And though he indeed usually began by protesting, he submitted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to her will, if her request was reasonable. An unseen harmony underlay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their visible strife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>That night, after Marfinka had left him, Vikentev had hurried to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Kolchino. He rushed to his mother, threw his arms round her and kissed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her. When, nearly smothered by his embrace, she thrust him from her, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fell on his knees and said solemnly: "Mother, strike me if you will, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>listen. The supreme moment of my life has arrived. I have...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Gone mad," she supplied, looking him up and down.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am going to be married," he said, almost inaudibly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What? Mavra, Anton, Ivan, Kusma! Come here, quick!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mavra alone responded to the call.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Call everybody. Nikolai Andreevich has gone mad."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not joking, and I must have an answer tomorrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will have you locked up," she said, seriously disturbed at last.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Far into the night the servants heard heated arguments, the voices of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the disputants now rising almost to a shout, then laughter, then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>outbursts of anger from the mistress, a gay retort from him, then dead</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silence, the sign of restored tranquillity. Vikentev had won the victory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which was indeed a foregone conclusion, for while Vikentev and Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were still uncertain of their feelings, Tatiana Markovna and Marfa</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Egorovna had long before realised what was coming, and both, although</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they kept their own counsel, had weighed and considered the matter, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had concluded that the marriage was a suitable one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What will Tatiana Markovna say?" cried Marfa Egorovna to her son the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>next morning as the horses were being put in. "If she does not agree, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will never forgive you for the disgrace it will bring on us, do you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hear?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She herself, in a silk dress and a lace mantle, with yellow gloves and a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coquettish fan, might have been a fiancИe. When Tatiana Markovna was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>informed of the arrival of Madame Vikentev, she had her shown into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reception room. Before she herself changed her dress to receive her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa had to peer through the doorway to see what kind of toilette</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the guest had made. Then Tatiana Markovna donned a rustling silk dress</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a silver sheen, over which she wore her Turkish shawl; she even</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tried to put on a pair of diamond earrings, but gave up the attempt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>impatiently, telling herself that the holes in her ears had grown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>together. Then she sent word to Vera and Marfinka to change their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dresses. In passing she told Vassilissa to set out the best table linen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the old silver and glass for the breakfast and the dinner table. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cook was ordered to serve chocolate in addition to the usual dishes, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sweets and champagne were ordered. With folded hands, adorned for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>occasion with old and costly rings, she stepped solemnly into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reception room. But when she caught sight of her guest's pleasant face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she all but forget the importance of the moment, but pulled herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>together in time, and resumed her serious aspect.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfa Egorovna rose in friendly haste to meet her hostess, and began:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What ideas my mad boy has!" but restrained herself when she saw Madame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Berezhkov's attitude. They exchanged ceremonious greetings. Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna asked the visitor to sit on the divan, and seated herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stiffly beside her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the weather like?" she asked. "Had you a windy crossing over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Volga?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There was no wind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Did you come by the ferry?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In the boat. The calХche was brought over on the ferry."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yakob, Egorovna, Petrushka? Where are you? Why don't you come when you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are called? Take out the horses, give them fodder, and see that the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coachman is well looked after."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The servants, who had rushed in to answer the summons, hurried out. Of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>course the horses had been taken out while Tatiana Markovna was dressing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the coachman was already sitting in the servants' room, doing full</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>justice to the beer set before him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no, Tatiana Markovna," protested the visitor, "I have come for half</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an hour on business."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you think you will be allowed to go?" asked Tatiana Markovna in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>voice that permitted no reply. "You have come a long way from over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volga. Is this the first year of our acquaintance? Do you want to insult</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, Tatiana Markovna, I am so grateful to you, so grateful! You are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>just like a relative, and how you have spoilt my Nikolai!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I feel sometimes as if he were my own son," burst from Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whose dignity could hold out no longer against these friendly advances.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, you are so kind to him, Tatiana Markovna, that, presuming on your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kindness, he has taken it into his head...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He begged me to come over to see you, and he asks for the hand of Marfa</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna. Marfa Vassilievna agrees; she loves Nikolai."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because Marfinka took upon herself to answer his declaration she is now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shut up in her room, in her petticoat, without shoes," lied her aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then in order to lay full stress on the importance of the moment, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>added: "I have given orders not to admit your son, so that he may not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>play with a poor girl's affections."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was impossible for Marfa Egorovna not to recognise the provocation of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these remarks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I had foreseen this," she said angrily, "I would have given him a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>different answer. He assured me--and I was so willing to believe him--of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your affection for him, and for me. Pardon my mission, Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and pray let that poor child out of her room. The blame rests with my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>boy only, and he shall be punished. Have the kindness to order my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carriage."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She placed her hand on the bell, but Tatiana Markovna detained her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your horses are taken out. You will stay with me, Marfa Egorovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-day, to-morrow, all the week."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But since you are so angry with Marfa Vassilievna and my son, who does</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indeed deserve to be punished?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The wrinkles in Tatiana Markovna's face faded, and her eyes gleamed with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>joy. She threw her shawl and cap on the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I can't keep it up any longer!" she exclaimed. "Take off your hat and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mantilla. We are only teasing one another, Marfa Egorovna. I shall have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a grandson, you a daughter. Kiss me, dear! I wanted to keep up the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>customs, but there are cases which they don't fit. We knew what must be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the upshot of this. If we hadn't wished it we should not have allowed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them to go and listen to the nightingales."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How you frightened me!" cried Marfa Egorovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He had to be frightened. I will read him a lesson."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mother and aunt had gone a long way into the future, and when they were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about as far as the christening of the third child, Marfa Egorovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>noticed in the garden among the bushes a head which was now hidden, then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>again cautiously raised to reconnoitre. She recognised her son, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pointed him out to Tatiana Markovna. They called him, but when he at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>last decided to enter, he hung about in the ante-room, as if he were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>making himself presentable.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are welcome, Nikolai Andreevich," said Tatiana Markovna pointedly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>while his mother looked at him ironically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good morning, Tatiana Markovna," he stammered at last, and kissed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old lady's hand. "I have bought tickets for the charity concert, for you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Mama, for Vera Vassilievna and Marfa Vassilievna and for Boris</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pavlovich. It's a splendid concert ... the first singer in Moscow...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do we need to go to concerts?" interrupted Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking at him sideways. "The nightingales sing so finely here. In the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>evening we go into the garden, and can hear them for nothing."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfa Egorovna bit her lip, but Vikentev stood transfixed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Sit down, Nikolai Andreevich," continued the old lady seriously and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reproachfully, "and listen to what I have to say. What does your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conscience tell you? How have you rewarded my confidence?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't make fun of me ... it's unkind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not joking. It wasn't right of you, my friend, to speak to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, and not to me. Supposing I had not consented?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you had not consented I would have...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh, I would have gone away from here, joined the Hussars, have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contracted debts, and gone to wrack and ruin."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now he threatens! You should not be so bent on your own way, young</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>man."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Give me Marfa Vassilievna, and I will be more tranquil than water,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>humbler than the grass."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Shall we give him Marfinka, Marfa Egorovna?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He hasn't deserved it, Tatiana Markovna. And it is really too early.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Perhaps in two years' time...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He flew to his mother and shut her mouth with a kiss. Then he received</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from Tatiana Markovna the sign of the cross, and a kiss on the forehead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is Marfa Vassilievna?" he shouted joyfully.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must have patience," admonished his grandmother, "we will fetch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna and Marfa Egorovna found Marfinka hidden in the corner</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind the curtains of her bed, close by the ikons. She covered her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blushing face in her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera received the news from her aunt with quiet pleasure, saying that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had expected it for a long time.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God grant that you may follow her example," said Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you love me as I love you, Grandmother, you will bestow all your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>care and thought on Marfinka. Take no thought for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My heart aches for you, Veroshka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I know, and that grieves me. Grandmother," she said with a despairing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>note, "it is killing me to think that your heart aches on my account."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you say, Veroshka? open your heart to me. Perhaps I can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>comprehend, and if you have grief, help to assuage it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If trouble overtakes me, Grandmother, and I cannot conquer it myself, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will come to you and to none other, God only excepted. But do not make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me suffer any more, or allow yourself to suffer."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will it not be too late when trouble has once overtaken you?" whispered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her aunt. Then she added aloud, "I know that you are not like Marfinka,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and I will not disturb you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A long sigh escaped her as she left the room with quick steps and bent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head. Vera's distress was the only cloud on her horizon, and she prayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>earnestly that it might pass and not gather into a black storm cloud.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera sought to calm her own agitation by walking up and down the garden,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but only succeeded gradually. As soon as she caught sight of Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Vikentev in the arbour, she hurried to them, looked affectionately</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into her sister's face, kissed her eyes, her lips, her cheeks, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>embraced her warmly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must be happy," she said with tears in her eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How lovely you are Veroshka, and how good! We are not a bit like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sisters. There is nobody in the neighbourhood fit to marry you, is there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikolai Andreevich?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera pressed her hand in silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nikolai Andreevich, do you know what she is?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"An angel," answered Vikentev as promptly as a soldier answers his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>officer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"An angel," mimicked Vera laughing, and pointing to a butterfly hovering</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over a flower. "There is an angel. But if you even touch him the colour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of his wings will be spoiled, and he will perhaps even lose a wing. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must spoil her, love and caress her, and God forbid that you ever wound</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her. If you ever do," she threatened, smiling, "you will have to reckon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Within a week of this happy occasion the house was restored to its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ordinary routine. Marfa Egorovna drove back to Kolchino, but Vikentev</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>became a daily visitor, and almost a member of the family. He and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka no longer jumped and ran like children, though they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>occasionally had a lively dispute, half in jest, half in earnest. They</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sang and read together, and the pure, fresh poetry of youth, plain for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all to read, welled up in their frank, unspoiled hearts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The wedding being fixed for the autumn, preparations for Marfinka's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house-furnishing and trousseau were being gradually pushed forward. From</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the cupboards of the house were brought old lace, silver and gold plate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glass, linen, furs, pearls, diamonds and all sorts of treasures, to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>divided by Tatiana Markovna with Jew-like exactness into two equal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shares, with the aid of jewellers, workers in gold, and others.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is yours, Vera, and there is Marfinka's share. You are not to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>receive a pearl or on ounce more than the other. See for yourselves."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera pushed pearls and diamonds into a heap with a declaration that she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>needed very little. This only angered Tatiana Markovna, who began the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>work of division all over again. Raisky sent to his former guardian for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the diamonds and silver that had been his mother's portion, and bestowed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these also on the sisters, but his aunt hid the treasure in the depths</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of her coffers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will want them yourself." she said, "on the day when you take it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into your head to marry."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The estate with all that belonged to it he had made over in the names of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sisters, a gift for which each of them thanked him after her fashion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna wrinkled her forehead, and looked askance at him, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she could not long maintain this attitude, and ended by embracing him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In various rooms, in Tatiana Markovna's sitting room, in the servants'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>room, and even in the reception room, tables were covered with linen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The marriage bed, with its lace pillow-cases and cover was being</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>prepared, and every morning there came dressmakers and seamstresses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Only Raisky and Vera remained untouched by the universal gay activity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Even when Raisky sought distraction in riding or visiting, there was in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fact no one else in the world for him but Vera. He avoided too frequent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>visits to Koslov on account of Juliana Andreevna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He did not visit Paulina Karpovna, but she came the oftener, and bored</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him and Tatiana Markovna by her pose, retiring or audacious, as the case</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>might be. Tatiana Markovna especially was annoyed by her unasked for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>criticisms of the wedding preparations, and by her views on marriage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>generally. Marriage, she declared, was the grave of love, elect souls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were bound to meet in spite of all obstacles, even outside the marriage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bond, and so forth. While she expounded these doctrines she cast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>languishing eyes on Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Neither did the young people who now often came to the house to dance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>awaken any interest in Raisky or Vera. These two were only happy under</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>given circumstances; he--with her, she--when unseen by anyone she could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flit like a ghost to the precipice to lose herself in the under-growth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or when she drove over the Volga to see the pope's wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The weather was gloomy. Rain fell unintermittently, the sky was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enshrouded in a thick cloud of fog, and on the ground lay banks of mist.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>No one had ventured out all day, and the family had already gone early</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to bed, when about ten o'clock the rain ceased, Raisky put on his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>overcoat to get a breath of air in the garden. The rustle of the bushes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the plants from which the rain was still dripping, alone broke the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stillness of the night. After a few turns up and down he turned his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>steps to the vegetable garden, through which his way to the fields lay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here and there a glimmering star hung above in the dense darkness, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before him the village lay like a dark spot on the dark background of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the indistinguishable fields beyond. Suddenly he heard a slight noise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from the old house, and saw that a window on the ground floor had been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opened. Since the window looked out not into the garden, but on to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>field, he hastened to reach the grove of acacias, leapt the fence and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>landed in a puddle of water, where he stood motionless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it you?" said a low voice from the window. It was Vera's voice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Though his knees trembled under him, he was just able to answer in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>same low tone, "Yes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The rain has kept me in all day, but to-morrow morning at ten. Go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quickly; some one is coming."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The window was closed quietly, and Raisky cursed the approaching</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>footsteps that had interrupted the conversation. It was then true, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the letter written on blue paper not a dream. Was there a rendezvous? He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went in the direction of the steps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is there?" cried a voice, and Raisky was seized from behind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The devil," cried Raisky, pushing Savili away, "since when have you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>taken upon yourself to guard the house?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have the Mistress's orders. There are so many thieves and vagabonds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the neighbourhood, and the sailors from the Volga do a lot of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mischief."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is a lie. You are out after Marina, and you ought to be ashamed of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He would have gone, but Savili detained him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Allow me, Sir, to say a word or two about Marina. Exercise your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>merciful powers, and send the woman to Siberia."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you out of your senses?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Or into a house of detention for the rest of her life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I'm much more likely to send you, so that you cease to beat her. What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are you doing, spying here in this abominable way?" said Raisky between</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his teeth, as he cast a glance at Vera's window. In another moment he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky hardly slept at all that night, and he appeared next morning in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his aunt's sitting-room with dry, weary eyes. The whole family had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>assembled for tea on this particular bright morning. Vera greeted him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gaily, as he pressed her hand feverishly and looked straight into her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes. She returned his gaze calmly and quietly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How elegant you are this morning," he said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you call a simple straw-coloured blouse elegant?" she asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But the scarlet band on your hair, with the coils of hair drawn across</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it, the belt with the beautiful clasp, and the scarlet-embroidered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shoes.... You have excellent taste, and I congratulate you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am glad that I meet with your approval, but your enthusiasm is rather</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strange. Tell me the reason of this extraordinary tone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good, I will tell you. Let us go for a stroll."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He saw that she gave him a quick glance of suspicion as he proposed an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appointment with her for ten o'clock. After a moment's thought she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>agreed, sat down in a corner, and was silent. About ten o'clock she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>picked up her work and her parasol, and signed to him to follow her as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she left the house. She walked in silence through the garden, and they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sat down on a bench at the top of the cliff.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It was by chance," said Raisky, who was hardly able to restrain his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>emotion, "that I have learnt a part of your secret."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So it seems," she answered coldly. "You were listening yesterday."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Accidentally, I swear."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I believe you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera, there is no longer any doubt that you have a lover. Who is he?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't ask."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is there in the world who could desire your happiness more ardently</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>than I do? Why have you confidence in him and not in me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because I love him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The man you love is to be envied, but how is he going to repay you for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the supreme happiness that you bring him? Be careful, my friend. To whom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do you give your confidence?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To myself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is the man?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Instead of answering him she looked full in his face, and he thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that her eyes were as colourless as those of a watersprite, and there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lay hidden in them a maddening riddle. From below in the bushes there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>came the sound of a shot. Vera rose immediately from the bench, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky also rose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"HE?" he asked in a dull voice. "It is ten o'clock."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She approached the precipice, Raisky following close at her heels. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>motioned him to come no farther.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the meaning of the shot?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He calls."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The writer of the blue letter. Not a step further unless you wish that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I leave here for ever."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She rapidly descended the precipice, and in a few moments had vanished</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind the brushwood and the trees. He called after her to take care,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but in reply heard only the crackling of the dry twigs beneath her feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then all was still. He was left to torment himself with wondering who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the object of her passion could be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was none other than Mark Volokov, pariah, cynic, gipsy, who would ask</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the first likely man he met for money, who levelled his gun on his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fellow-men, and, like Karl Moor, had declared war on mankind--Mark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volokov, the man under police supervision.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was to meet this dangerous and suspicious character that Vera stole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the rendezvous--Vera, the pearl of beauty in the whole neighbourhood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whose beauty made strong men weak; Vera, who had mastered even the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tyrannical Tatiana Markovna; Vera, the pure maiden sheltered from all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the winds of heaven. It would have seemed impossible for her to meet a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>man against whom all houses were barred. It had happened so simply, so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>easily, towards the end of the last summer, at the time that the apples</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were ripe. She was sitting one evening in the little acacia arbour by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the fence near the old house, looking absently out into the field, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away to the Volga and the hills beyond, when she became aware that a few</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>paces away the branches of the apple tree were swaying unnaturally over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the fence. When she looked more closely she saw that a man was sitting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>comfortably on the top rail. He appeared by his face and dress to belong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the lower class; he was not a schoolboy, but he held in his hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>several apples.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are you doing here?" she asked, just as he was about to spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>down from the fence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am eating," he said, after taking a look at her. "Will you try one?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he added, hitching himself along the fence towards her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked at him curiously, but without fear, as she drew back a little.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who are you?" she said severely. "And why do you climb on to other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>people's fences."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What can it matter to you who I am. I can easily tell you why I climb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on other people's fences. It is to eat apples."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Aren't you ashamed to take other people's apples?" she asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"They are my apples, not theirs; they have been stolen from me. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>certainly have not read Proudhon. But how beautiful you are!" he added</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in amazement. "Do you know what Proudhon says?" he concluded.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"_La propriИtИ c'est le vol_."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, you have read Proudhon." He stared at her, and as she shook her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head, he continued, "Anyway, you have heard it. Indeed, this divine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>truth has gone all round the world nowadays. I have a copy of Proudhon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and will bring it to you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are not a boy, and yet you steal apples. You think it is not theft</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to do so because of that saying of Proudhon's."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You believe, then, everything that was told you at school? But please</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell me who you are. This is the Berezhkovs' garden. They tell me the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old lady has two beautiful nieces."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I too say what can it matter to you who I am?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then you believe what your Grandmother tells you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I believe in what convinces me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Exactly like me," he said, taking off his cap. "Is it criminal in your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes to take apples?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not criminal, perhaps, but not good manners."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I make you a present of them," he said, handing her the remaining four</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>apples and taking another bite out of his own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He raised his cap once more and bid her an ironic good-day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have a double beauty, you are beautiful to look at and sensible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the bargain. It is a pity that you are destined to adorn the life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of an idiot. You will be given away, poor girl."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No pity, if you please. I shall not be given away like an apple."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You remember the apples; many thanks for the gift. I will bring you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books in exchange, as you like books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Proudhon?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Proudhon and others. I have all the new ones. Only you must not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell your Grandmother and her stupid visitors, for although I do not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>know who they are, I don't think they would have anything to do with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How do you know? You have only seen me for five minutes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The stag's breed is never hidden, one sees at once that you belong to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the living, not to the dead-alive, and that is the main point. The rest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>comes with opportunity...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have a free mind, as you yourself say, and you immediately want to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>overpower it. Who are you that you should take upon yourself to instruct</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are neither to bring me books, nor to come here again yourself,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she said, rising to go. "There is a watchman here, and he will seize</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is like the Grandmother again. It smells of the town and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Lenten oil, and I thought that you loved the wide world and freedom. Are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you afraid of me, and who do you think I am?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A seminarist, perhaps," she said laconically.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, seminarists are unconventional, badly dressed, and always hungry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Go into the kitchen, and I will tell them to give you something to eat."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That's very kind. Did anything else about the seminarists strike you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not acquainted with any of them, and have seen very little of them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at all; they are so unpolished, and talk so queerly...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"They are our real missionaries, and what does it matter if they talk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>queerly? While we laugh at them they attack the enemy, blindly perhaps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but at any rate with enthusiasm."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What enemy?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The world; they fight for the new knowledge, the new life. Healthy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>virile youth needs air and food, and we need such men."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We? Who?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The new-born strength of the world."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you then represent the 'new-born strength of the world,'" she said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking at him with observant, curious eyes, but without irony, "or is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your name a secret?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Would it frighten you if I named it?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What could it mean to me if you did disclose it? What is it?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mark Volokov. In this silly place my name is heard with nearly as much</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terror as if it were Pugachev or Stenka Razin."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are that man?" she said, looking at him with rising curiosity. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>boast of your name, which I have heard before. You shot at Niel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Andreevich, and let a couple of dogs loose on an old lady. There are the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>manifestations of your 'new strength.' Go, and don't be seen here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Otherwise you will complain to Grandmama?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I certainly shall. Good-bye."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She left the arbour and walked away without listening to his rejoinder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He followed her covetously with his eyes, murmuring as he sprang to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ground a wish that those apples also could be stolen. Vera, for her part,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said not a word to her aunt of this meeting, but she confided</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nevertheless in her friend Natalie Ivanovna after exacting a promise of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>secrecy.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After leaving Raisky, Vera listened for a while to make sure he was not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>following her, and then, pushing the branches of the undergrowth aside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with her parasol, made her way by the familiar path to the ruined arbour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whose battered doorway was almost barricaded by the fallen timbers. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>steps of the arbour and the planks of the floor had sunk, and rotten</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>planks cracked under her feet. Of its original furniture there was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing left but two moss-grown benches and a crooked table.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark was already in the arbour, and his rifle and huntsman's bag lay on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the table. He held out his hand to Vera, and almost lifted her in over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the shattered steps. By way of welcome he merely commented on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lateness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The weather detained me," she said. "Have you any news?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Did you expect any?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I expect every day that you will be sent for by the military or the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>police."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have been more careful since Raisky played at magnanimity and took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>upon himself the fuss about the books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't like that about you, Mark, your callousness and malice towards</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everyone except yourself. My cousin made no parade of what he had done;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he did not even mention it to me. You are incapable of appreciating a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kindness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do appreciate it in my own way."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Just as the wolf in the fable appreciated the kindness of the crane.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Why not thank him with the same simplicity with which he served you. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are a real wolf; you are for ever disparaging, detracting, or blaming</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>someone, either from pride or...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Or what?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Or by way of cultivating the 'new strength.'"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Scoffer!" he laughed, as he sat down beside her. "You are young, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>still too inexperienced to be disillusioned of all the charm of the good</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old times. How can I instruct you in the rights of mankind?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And how am I to cure you of the slandering of mankind?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have always a retort handy, and nobody could complain of dullness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with you, but," he said, clutching meditatively at his head, "if I...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Am locked up by the police," she finished. "That seems to be all that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your fate still lacks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But for you, I should long ago have been sent off somewhere. You are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a disturbing element."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you tired of living peaceably, and already craving for a storm? You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>promised me to lead a different life. What have you not promised me? And</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I was so happy that they even noticed my delight at home. And now you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have relapsed into your old mood," she protested, as he seized her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pretty hand!" he said, kissing it again and again without any objection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from her, but when he sought to kiss her cheek she drew back.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You refuse again. Is your reserve never to end? Perhaps you keep your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>caresses for...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She drew her hand away hastily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You know I do not like jests of that kind. You must break yourself of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this tone, and of wolfish manners generally; that would be the first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>step towards unaffected manhood."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tone and manners! You are a child still occupied with your ABC. Before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you lie freedom, life, love, happiness, and you talk of tone and manners.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Where is the human soul, the woman in you? What is natural and genuine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now you are talking like Raisky."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, Raisky! Is he still so desperate?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"More than ever, so that I really don't know how to treat him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Lead him by the nose."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How hideous! It would be best to tell him the truth about myself. If he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knew all he would be reconciled and would go away, as he said he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intended to do long ago."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He will hate you, read you a lecture, and perhaps tell your Aunt."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God forbid that she should hear the truth except from ourselves. Should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I go away for a time?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why? It could not be arranged for you to be away long, and if your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>absence was short he would be only the more agitated. When you were away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what good did it do. There is only one way and that is to conceal the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>truth from him, to put him on a wrong track. Let him cherish his passion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>read verses, and gape at the moon, since he is an incurable Romanticist.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Later on he will sober down and travel once more."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is not a Romanticist in the sense you mean," sighed Vera. "You may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fairly call him poet, artist. I at least begin to believe in him, in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>delicacy and his truthfulness. I would hide nothing from him if he did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not betray his passion for me. If he subdues that, I will be the first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to tell him the whole truth."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We did not meet," interrupted Mark, "to talk so much about him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, what have you done since we last met?" she asked gaily. "Whom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have you met? Have you been discoursing on the 'new strength' or the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'dawn of the future,' or 'young hopes?' Every day I live in anxious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expectation."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no," laughed Mark. "I have ceased to bother about the people here;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it is not worth while to tackle them."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God grant it were so. You would have done well if you had acted up to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what you say. But I cannot be happy about you. At the Sfogins, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>youngest son, Volodya, who is fourteen, declared to his mother that he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was not going any more to Mass. When he was whipped, and questioned, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pointed to his eldest brother, who had sneaked into the servants' room</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and there preached to the maids the whole evening that it was stupid to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>observe the fasts of the Church, to go through the ceremony of marriage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that there was no God...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark looked at her in horror.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In the servants' room! And yet I talked to him for a whole evening as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if he were a man capable of reason, and gave him books...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Which he took straight to the bookseller. 'These are the books you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ought to put on sale,' he said. Did you not give me your promise," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said reproachfully, "when we parted and you begged to see me again?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"All that is long past. I have had nothing more to do with those people</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>since I gave you that promise. Don't be angry, Vera. But for you I would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>escape from this neighbourhood to-morrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Escape--where? Everywhere there are the same opportunities; boys who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would like to see their moustaches grow quicker, servants' rooms, if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>independent men and women will not listen to your talk. Are you not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ashamed of the part you play?" she asked after a brief pause. "Do you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>look on it as your mission?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She stroked his bent head affectionately as she spoke. At her last words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he raised his head quickly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What part do I play? I give a baptism of pure water."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you convinced of the pureness of the water?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Listen, Vera. I am not Raisky," said Mark, rising. "You are a woman, or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rather one should say a bud which has yet to unfold into womanhood. When</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that unfolding comes many secrets will be clear to you that have no part</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in a girl's dreams and that cannot be explained; experience is the sole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>key to these secrets. I call you to your initiation, Vera; I show you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the path of life. But you stand hesitating on the threshold, and your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>advance is slow. The serious thing is that you don't even believe me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not be vexed," begged Vera affectionately. "I agree with you in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everything that I recognise as right and honourable. If I cannot always</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>follow you in life and in experience it is because I desire to know and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>see for myself the goal for which I am making."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is to say, that you wish to judge for yourself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And do you desire that I should not judge for myself?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I love you, Vera. Put your trust in me, and obey. Does the flame of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passion burn in me less strongly than in your Raisky, for all his poetry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Passion is chary of words. But you will neither trust nor obey me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Would you have me not stand at the level of my personality? You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself preached freedom to me, and now the tyrant in you appears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>because I do not show a slavish submission."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let us part, Vera, if doubt is uppermost with you and you have no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>confidence in me, for in that fashion we cannot continue our meetings."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, let us part rather than that you should exact a blind trust in you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In my waking hours and in my dreams I imagine that there lies between us</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no disturbance, no doubt. But I don't understand you, and therefore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cannot trust you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You hide under your Aunt's skirts like a chicken under a hen, and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have absorbed her ideas and her system of morals. You, like Raisky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>inshroud passion in fantastic draperies. Let us put aside all the other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>questions untouched. The one that lies before us is simple and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>straightforward. We love one another. Is that so or not?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What does that lead to, Mark!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you don't believe me, look around you. You have spent your whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>life in the woods and fields, and do you learn nothing from what you see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in all directions?" he asked, pointing to a swarm of flying pigeons, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the nesting swallows. "Learn from them; they deal in no subtleties!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, they circle round their nests. One has flown away, probably in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>search of food."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When winter comes they will all separate."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And return in spring to the same nest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I believe you when you talk reasonably, Vera. You felt injured by my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rough manners, and I am making every effort. I have transformed myself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the old-fashioned pattern, and shall soon shift my feet and smile</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when I make my bow like Tiet Nikonich. I don't give way to the desire to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>abuse or to quarrel with anybody, and draw no attention to my doings. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shall next be making up my mind to attend Mass, what else should I do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are in the mood for joking, but joking is not what I wanted,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sighed Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So far I have not even been able to persuade you to spare yourself for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my sake, to cease your baptisms, to live like other people."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But if I act in accordance with my convictions?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is your aim? What do you hope to do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I teach fools."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you even know yourself what you teach, for what you have been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>struggling for a whole year? To live the life that you prescribe is not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>within the bounds of possibility. It is all very new and bold, but...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There we are again at the same old point. I can hear the old lady</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>piping," he laughed scornfully, pointing in the direction of the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You speak with her voice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is that your whole answer, Mark? Everything is a lie; therefore, away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with it! But the absence of any notion of what truth is to supersede the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lies makes me distrustful."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You set reflexion above nature and passion. You are noble, and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>naturally desire marriage. But that has nothing to do with love, and it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is love and happiness that I seek."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera rose and looked at him with blazing eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I wished only for marriage, Mark, I should naturally make another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>choice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pardon me, I was rude," he said in real embarrassment, and kissed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hand. "But, Vera, you repress your love, you are afraid, and instead of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>giving yourself up to the pleasure of it you are for ever analysing."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I try to find out who and what you are, because love is not a passing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pleasure to me, but you look on it as a distraction."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, as a daily need of life, which is no matter for jesting. Like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, I cannot sleep through the long nights, and I suffer nervous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>torture that I could not have believed possible. You say you love me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that I love you is plain? But I call you to happiness and you are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afraid...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do not want happiness for a month, for six months--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For your life long, and even after death?" asked Mark, scornfully.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For life! I do not want to foresee an ultimate limit. I do not and will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not believe in happiness with a term. But I do believe in another kind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of intimate happiness, and I want...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To make me embrace the same belief."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, I know no other happiness, and I would scorn it if I knew it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good-bye, Vera. You do not love me, but are for ever disputing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>analysing either my character or the nature of happiness. We always get</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back to the point from which we started. I think it is your destiny to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>love Raisky. You can make what you will of him, can deck him out with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all your Aunt's tags, and evolve a new hero of romance every day, for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ever and ever. I haven't the time for that kind of thing. I have work to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah work, and love, with happiness as an afterthought, a trifle...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you wish to build a life out of love after the old fashion, a life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>such as that lived by the swallows who leave their nest only to seek</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>food."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You would fly for a moment into a strange nest, and then forget."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, if forgetting is so easy; but if one cannot forget, one returns.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But must I return if I don't want to? Is that compatible with freedom?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Would you ask that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot understand a bird's life of that kind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Farewell, Vera. We were mistaken. I want a comrade, not a school girl."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Mark, a comrade, strong like yourself, I agree. A comrade for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole of life, is that not so?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I thought," said Mark as if he had not heard her last question, "that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>we should soon be united, and that whether we separated again must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>depend on temperament and circumstances. You make your analysis in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>advance, so that your judgment is as crooked and twisted as an old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>maid's could be. You don't look to the quarter whence truth and light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must come. Sleep, my child. I was mistaken. Farewell once more. We will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>try to avoid one another in the future."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We will try. But can we really not find happiness together? What is the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hindrance?" she asked, in a low, agitated tone, touching his hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark shouldered his gun in silence, and walked out of the arbour into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the brushwood. Vera stood motionless as if she were in a deep sleep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Overcome by grief and amazement, she could not believe he was really</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leaving her. Where there is no trust there is no love, she thought. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not trust him, and yet, if she did not love him, why was her grief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and pain at his going so great. Why did she feel that death itself would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be welcome?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mark!" she cried in a low voice. He did not look round, and although</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she repeated the cry he strode forward. "Mark!" she cried breathlessly a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>third time, but he still pursued his path. Her face faded, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mechanically she picked up her handkerchief and her parasol and mounted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the cliff. Were truth and love to be found there where her heart called</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her? Or did truth lie in the little chapel that she was now approaching?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For four days Vera wandered in the park, and waited in the arbour, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark did not come. There was no reply to the call of her heart. She no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>longer hid her movements from Raisky, who came upon her from time to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time in the chapel. She allowed him to accompany her to the little</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>village church on the hill where she usually went alone. She remained on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her knees with bowed head for a long time, while he stood motionless</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind her. Then without a word or a glance, she took his arm, to return</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wearily to the old house, where they parted. Vera knew nothing of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>secret suffering, of the passionate love which attracted him to her, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>double love of a man for a woman, and of an artist for his ideal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky wondered what the shots meant. It need not necessarily be love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that drove her to the rendezvous. There might be a secret of another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kind, but the key to the mystery lay in her heart. There was no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>salvation for her except in love, and he longed to give her protection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and freedom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Again he found her at twilight praying in the chapel, but this time she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was calm and her eyes clear. She gave him her hand, and was plainly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pleased to see him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You cannot imagine, Vera," he said, "how happy it makes me to see you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>calmer. What has given you peace?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She glanced towards the chapel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You don't go down there any more?" he said, pointing to the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank God!" he cried. "If you are going home now, take my arm," he said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and they walked together along the path leading across the meadow. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have been fighting a hard and despairing battle, Vera. So much you do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not conceal. Are you going to conquer this agonising and dangerous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passion?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And if I do, Cousin?" she asked despondently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The richer for a great experience, strengthened against future storms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your portion will be a great happiness, sufficient to fill your whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot comprehend any other happiness," she said, thoughtfully. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stood still, leaning her head on his shoulder, and her eyes filled with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tears. He did not know that he had probed her wound by touching on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>very point that had caused her separation from Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At that moment there was the report of a shot in the depths below the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice, and the sound was re-echoed from the hills. Raisky and Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>both started. She stood listening for a moment. Her eyes, still wet with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tears, were wide and staring now. Then she loosed her hold of his arm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and hurried in the direction of the precipice, with Raisky hurrying at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her heels. When she had gone half way, she stopped, laid her hand on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart, and listened once more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A few minutes ago your mind was made up, Vera!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky's face was pale, and his agitation nearly as great as hers. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not hear his words, and she looked at him without seeing him. Then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she took a few steps in the direction of the precipice, but suddenly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>turned to go slowly towards the chapel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am not going," she whispered. "Why does he call me? It cannot be that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he has changed his attitude in the last few days."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She sank down on her knees before the sacred picture, and covered her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face with her hands. Raisky came up to her, and implored her not to go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She herself gazed at the picture with expressionless, hopeless eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When she rose she shuddered, and seemed unaware of Raisky's presence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A shot sounded once more. With a cry Vera ran over the meadow towards</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the cliff. Perhaps my conviction has conquered, she thought. Why else</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should he call her? Her feet hardly seemed to touch the grass as she ran</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the avenue that led to the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XX</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera came that night to supper with a gloomy face. She eagerly drank a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glass of milk, but offered no remark to anyone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why are you so unhappy, Veroshka?" asked her aunt. "Don't you feel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>well."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was afraid to ask," interposed Tiet Nikonich politely. "I could not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>help noticing, Vera Vassilievna, that you have been altered for some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time; you seem to have grown thinner and paler. The change becomes your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looks, but the symptoms ought not to be overlooked, as they might</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indicate the approach of illness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have a little tooth-ache, but it will soon pass," answered Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unwillingly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna looked away sadly enough, but said nothing, while</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky tapped his plate absently with a fork, but ate nothing, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>maintained a gloomy silence. Only Marfinka and Vikentev took every dish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that was offered them, and chattered without intermission.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera soon took her leave, followed by Raisky. She went into the park,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and stood at the top of the cliff looking down into the dark wood below</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her; then she wrapped herself in her mantilla, and sat down on the bench.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Silently she acceded to Raisky's request to be allowed to sit down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beside her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are in trouble, and are suffering, Vera."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have tooth-ache."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is your heart that aches, Vera. Share your trouble with me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I make no complaint."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have an unhappy love affair, with whom?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She did not answer. She knew that her hopes were still not dead, mad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>though they might be. What if she went away for a week or two to breathe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to conjure up her strength.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Cousin," she said at last, "to-morrow at daybreak I am going across the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volga, and may stay away longer than usual. I have not said good-bye to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother. Please say it for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will go away too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wait, Cousin, until I am a little calmer. Perhaps then I can confide in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you, and we can part like brother and sister, but now it is impossible.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Still, in case you do go away, let us say good-bye now. Forgive me my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strange ways, and let me give you a sister's kiss."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She kissed him on the forehead and walked quickly away, but she had only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>taken a few steps before she paused to say: "Thank you for all you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>done for me. I have not the strength to tell you how grateful I am for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your friendship, and above all for this place. Farewell, and forgive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera," he cried in painful haste. "Let me stay as long as you are here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or are in the neighbourhood. Even if we don't see one another, I yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>know where you are. I will wait till you are calmer, till you fulfil</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your promise, and confide in me, as you have said you would. You won't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be far away, and we can at least write to one another. Give me at least</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this consolation, for God's sake," he murmured passionately. "Leave me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at least that Paradise which is next door to Hell."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked at him with a distraught air, and bent her head in assent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But she saw the glow of delight which swept over his agitated face, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wondered sorrowfully why _he_ did not speak like that.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will put off my journey till the day after tomorrow. Good-night!" she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said, and gave him her hand to kiss before they separated.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Early next day Vera gave Marina a note with instructions to deliver it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and to wait for the answer. After the receipt of the answer she grew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>more cheerful and went out for a walk along the riverside. That evening</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she told her aunt that she was going on a visit to Natalie Ivanovna, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>took leave of them all, promising Raisky not to forget him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The next day a fisherman from the Volga brought him a letter from Vera,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in which she called him "dear cousin," and seemed to look forward to a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happier future. Into the friendly tone of the letter he contrived to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>read tender feeling, and he forgot, in his delight, his doubts, his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anxiety, the blue letters, and the precipice. He wrote and dispatched</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>immediately a brief, affectionate reply.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's letter aroused in him the artist sense, and drove him to set out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his chaotic emotions in defined form. He sought to crystallise his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thoughts and affections; his very passion took artistic shape, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>assumed in the clear light Vera's charming features.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are you scribbling day and night?" inquired Tatiana Markovna. "Is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it a play or another novel?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I write and write, Granny, and don't know myself how it will end."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It doesn't matter what the child does so long as he is amused," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remarked, not altogether missing the character of Raisky's occupation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But why do you write at night, when I am so afraid of fire, and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>might fall asleep over your drama. You will make yourself ill, and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>often look as yellow as an over-ripe gherkin as it is."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked in the glass, and was struck with his own appearance. Yellow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>patches were visible on the nose and temples, and there were grey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>threads in his thick, black hair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I were fair," he grumbled, "I should not age so quickly. Don't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bother about me, Granny, but leave me my freedom. I can't sleep."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You too ask me for freedom, like Vera. It is as if I held you both in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chains," she added with an anxious sigh. "Go on writing, Borushka, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not at night. I cannot sleep in peace, for when I look at your window</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the light is always burning."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will answer for it, Grandmother, that there shall be no fire, and if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I myself were to be burnt...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Touch wood! Do not tempt fate. Remember the saying that 'my tongue is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my enemy.'"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Suddenly Raisky sprang from the divan and ran to the window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is a peasant bringing a letter from Vera," he cried, as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hurried out of the room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"One might think it was his father in person," said Tatiana Markovna to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself. "How many candles he burns with his novels and plays, as many</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as four in a night!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Again Raisky received a few lines from Vera. She wrote that she was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>longing to see him again, and that she wanted to ask for his services.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She added the following postscript:--</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Dear Friend and Cousin, you taught me to love and to suffer, and poured</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the strength of your love into my soul. This it is that gives me courage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to ask you to do a good deed. There is here an unhappy man who has been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>driven from his home and lies under the suspicion of the Government. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>has no place to lay his head, and everyone, either from indifference or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fear, avoids him. But you are kind and generous, and cannot be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indifferent; still less will you hesitate to do a deed of pure charity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The wretched man has not a kopek, has no clothes, and autumn is coming</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If your heart tells you, as I don't doubt it will, what to do, address</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the wife of the acolyte, Sekleteia Burdalakov, but arrange it so that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neither Grandmother, nor anyone at home, knows anything of it. A sum of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>three hundred roubles will be sufficient, I think, to provide for him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for a whole year, perhaps two hundred and fifty would suffice. Will you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>put in a cloak and a warm vest (in my firm belief in your kind heart and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your love to me, I enclose the measures taken by the village tailor) to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>protect him from the cold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't like to ask you for a rug for him; that would be to make an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unfair use of kindness. In the winter the poor exile will probably leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the place, and will bless you, and to some degree me as well. I would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not have troubled you, but you know that my Grandmother has all my money,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which is therefore inaccessible."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What on earth is the meaning of this postscript?" cried Raisky. "The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole note is certainly not from her hand; she could not have written</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like this."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He threw himself on the divan in a fit of nervous laughter. He was in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna's sitting-room, with Vikentev and Marfinka. At first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the lovers laughed, but stopped when they saw the violent character of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his mirth. Tatiana Markovna, who came in at this moment, offered him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some drops of cordial in a teaspoon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Grandmother," he cried, still laughing violently. "Don't give me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drops, but three hundred roubles."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you want the money for?" said Tatiana Markovna hesitating. "Is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it for Markushka again. You had much better ask him to return the eighty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roubles he has had."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He entered into the spirit of the bargain, and eventually had to content</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself with two hundred and fifty roubles, which he dispatched next day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the address given. He also ordered the cloak and vest, and bought a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>warm rug, to be sent in a few days.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I thank you heartily, and with tears, dear Cousin," ran the letter he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>received in return for his gifts. "I cannot express in writing the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gratitude I feel. Heaven, not I, will reward you. How delighted the poor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exile was with your gift. He laughed for joy, and is wearing the new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things. He immediately paid his landlord his three months' arrears of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rent, and a month in advance. He only allowed himself to spend three</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roubles in cigars, which he has not smoked for a long time, and smoking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is his only passion."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Although the apocryphal nature of this remarkable missive was quite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>clear to Raisky, he did not hesitate to add a box of cigars to his gift</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the "poor exile." It was enough for him that Vera's name was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>attached to this pressing request. He observed the course of his own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passion as a physician does disease. As he watched the clouds driven</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before the wind, or looked at the green carpet of the earth, now taking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on sad autumnal hues, he realised that Nature was marching on her way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through never ending change, with not a moment's stagnation. He alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brooded idly with no prize in view. He asked himself anxiously what his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>duty was, and begged that Reason would shed some light on his way, give</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him boldness to leap over the funeral pyre of his hopes. Reason told him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to seek safety in flight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He drove into the town to buy some necessities for the journey, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there met the Governor who reproached him with having hidden himself for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so long. Raisky excused himself on the ground of ill-health, and spoke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of his approaching departure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is all one to me," returned Raisky gloomily. "Here I am so bored</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that I must seek some distraction. I intend going to St. Petersburg,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then to my estate in the government of R---- and then perhaps abroad."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't wonder that you are bored with staying in the same spot, since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you avoid society, and must need distraction. Will you make an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expedition with me? I am starting on a tour of the district to-morrow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>why not come with me? You will see much that is beautiful, and, being a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>poet, you will collect new impressions. We will travel for a hundred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>versts by river. Don't forget your sketch-book."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky shook the Governor's proffered hand, and accepted. The Governor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>showed him his well-equipped travelling carriage, declared that his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kitchen would travel with him, and cards should not be forgotten, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>promised himself a gayer journey than would have been possible in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sole society of a busy secretary.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky felt a relief in the firm determination he now made to conquer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his passion, and decided not to return from this journey, but to have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his effects sent after him. While he was away he wrote in this sense to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera, telling her that his life in Malinovka had been like an evil dream</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>full of suffering, and that if he ever saw the place again it would be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at some distant date.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A day or two later he received a short answer from Vera dated from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Malinovka. Marfinka's birthday fell during the next week, and when the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>festival was over she was to go on a long visit to her future</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mother-in-law. If Raisky did not make some sacrifice and return,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a sacrifice to her grandmother and herself, Tatiana Markovna would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be terribly lonely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Next evening he had a letter from Vera acquiescing in his intention of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leaving Malinovka without seeing her again, and saying that immediately</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>after the dispatch of this letter she would go over to her friend on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other side of the Volga, but she hoped that he would go to say good-bye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Tatiana Markovna and the rest of the household, as his departure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without any farewell must necessarily cause surprise in the town, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would hurt Tatiana Markovna's feelings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>This answer relieved him enormously. On the afternoon of the next day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when he alighted from the carriage in the outskirts of the town and bade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his travelling host good-bye, he was in good enough spirits as he picked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up his bag and made his way to the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka and Vikentev were the first to meet him, the dogs leaped to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>welcome him, the servants hurried up, and the whole household showed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>such genuine pleasure at his return that he was moved almost to tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked anxiously round to see if Vera was there, but one and another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hastened to tell him that Vera had gone away. He ought to have been glad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to hear this news, but he heard it with a spasm of pain. When he entered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his aunt's room she sent Pashutka out and locked the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How anxiously I have been expecting you!" she said. "I wanted to send a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>messenger for you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the matter?" he exclaimed, pale with terror in fear of bad news</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your friend Leonti Ivanovich is ill."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Poor fellow! What is wrong? Is it dangerous? I will go to him at once."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will have the horses put in. In the meantime I may as well tell you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what is known all over the town. I have kept it secret from Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only, and Vera already knows it. His wife has left him, and he has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fallen ill. Yesterday and the day before the Koslovs' cook came to fetch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where has she gone?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Away with the Frenchman, Charles, who was suddenly called to St.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Petersburg. She pretended she was going to stay with her relations in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Moscow and said that Monsieur Charles would accompany her so far. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>extracted from Koslov a pass giving her permission to live alone, and is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now with Charles in St. Petersburg."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Her relations with Charles," replied Raisky, "were no secret to anybody</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>except her husband. Everyone will laugh at him, but he will understand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing, and his wife will return."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have not heard the end. On her way she wrote to her husband telling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him to forget her, not to expect her return, because she could no longer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>endure living with him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The fool! Just as if she had not made scandal enough. Poor Leonti! I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will go to him, how sorry I am for him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Borushka, I am sorry for him too, and should like to have gone to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>see him. He has the simple honesty of a child. God has given him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>learning, but no common sense, and he is buried in his books. I wonder</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who is looking after him now. If you find he is not being properly cared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for, bring him here. The old house is empty, and we can establish him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there for the time being. I will have two rooms got ready for him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a woman you are, Grandmother. While I am thinking, you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>acted."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he reached Koslov's house he found the shutters of the grey house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were closed, and he had to knock repeatedly before he was admitted. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passed through the ante-room into the dining-room and stood uncertain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before the study door, hesitating whether he should knock or go straight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in. Suddenly the door opened, and there stood before him, dressed in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman's dressing-gown and slippers, Mark Volokov, unbrushed, sleepy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pale, thin and sinister.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The evil one has brought you at last," he grumbled half in surprise and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>half in vexation. "Where have you been all this time? I have hardly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slept for two nights. His pupils are about in the day time, but at night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he is alone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the matter with him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Has no one told you. That she-goat has gone. I was pleased to hear it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and came at once to congratulate him, but I found him with not a drop of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blood in his face, with dazed eyes, and unable to recognise anyone. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>just escaped brain fever. Instead of weeping for joy, the man has nearly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>died of sorrow. I fetched the doctor, but Koslov sent him away, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>walked up and down the room like one demented. Now he is sleeping, so we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will not disturb him. I will go, and you must stay, and see that he does</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not do himself some injury in a fit of melancholy. He listens to no one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and I have been tempted to smack him." Mark spit with vexation. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>can't depend on his idiot of a cook. Yesterday the woman gave him some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tooth powder instead of his proper powder. I am going to dismiss her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-morrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky watched him in amazement, and offered his hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What favour is this?" said Mark bitterly, and without taking the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>proffered hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I thank you for having stood by my old friend."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark seized Raisky's hand and shook it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have been looking for some means of serving you for a long time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why, Volokov, are you for ever executing quick changes like a clown in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a circus?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What the devil have I to do with your gratitude? I am not here for that,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but on Koslov's account."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God be with you and your manners, Mark Ivanovich!" replied Raisky. "In</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>any case, you have done a good deed."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"More praise. You can be as sentimental as you like for all I care...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will take Leonti home with me," resumed Raisky. "He will be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>absolutely at home there, and if his troubles do not blow over he will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have his own quiet corner all his life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Bravo! that is deeds, not words. Koslov would wither without a home and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without care. It is an excellent idea you have taken into your head."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It comes not from me, but from a woman, and not from her head, but from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her heart. My Aunt...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The old lady has a sound heart. I must go and breakfast with her one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>day. It is a pity she has amassed so many foolish ideas. Now I am going.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Look after Koslov, if not personally, through some one else. The day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before yesterday his head had to be cooled all day, and at night cabbage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leaves should be laid on it. I was a little disturbed, because in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dazed state he got the cabbage and began to eat it. Good-bye! I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>neither slept nor eaten, though Avdotya has treated me to a horrible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brew of coffee...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Allow me to send the coachman home to fetch some supper," said Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I would rather eat at home."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Perhaps you have no money," said Raisky nervously drawing out his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pocket book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have money," said Mark enigmatically, hardly able to restrain a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>callous laugh, "I am going to the bath-house before I have my supper, as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I haven't been able to undress here. I have changed my quarters, and now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>live with a clerical personage."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You look ill, thin, and your eyes...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark's face grew more evil and sinister than before.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You too look worse," he said. "If you look in the glass you will see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yellow patches and hollow eyes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have many causes of anxiety."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So have I. Good-bye," said Mark, and was gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went into the study and walked up to the bed on tiptoe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is there?" asked Leonti feebly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Leonti recognised Raisky he pushed his feet out of bed, and sat up.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is he gone?" he asked weakly. "I pretended to be asleep. You have not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been for so long, and I have been expecting you all the time. The face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of an old comrade is the only one that I can bear to see."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have been away, and heard when I returned of your illness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is gossip. There is a conspiracy to say I am ill, which is all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>foolish talk. Mark, who even fetched a doctor, has been hanging about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here as if he were afraid I should do myself an injury," said Leonti and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>paced up and down the room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are weak, and walk with difficulty," said Raisky. "It would be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>better for you to lie down."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am weak, that is true," admitted Leonti.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He bent over the chair-back to Raisky, embraced him, and laid his face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>against his hair. Raisky felt hot tears on his forehead and cheeks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is weakness," sobbed Leonti. "But I am not ill, and have not brain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fever. They talk, but don't understand. And I understood nothing either,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but now that I see you, I cannot keep back my tears. Don't abuse me like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark, or laugh at me, as they all do, my colleagues and my sympathetic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>visitors. I can discern malicious laughter on all their faces."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I respect and understand your tears and your sorrow," said Raisky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stifling his own tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are my kind old comrade. Even at school you never laughed at me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and do you know why I weep?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti took a letter from his desk and handed it to Raisky. It was the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>letter from Juliana Andreevna of which Tatiana Markovna had spoken.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky glanced through it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Destroy it," he said. "You will have no peace while it is in your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>possession."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Destroy it!" said Leonti, seizing the letter, and replacing it in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>desk. "How is it possible to think of such a thing, when these are the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only lines she has written me, and these are all that I have as a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>souvenir?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Leonti! Think of all this as a malady, a terrible misfortune, and don't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>succumb to it. You are not an old man, and have a long life before you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My life is over, unless she returns to me," he whispered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What! You could, you would take her back!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You, too, Boris, fail to understand me!" cried Leonti in despair, as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thrust his hands into his hair and strode up and down. "People keep on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saying I am ill, they offer sympathy, bring a doctor, sit all night by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my bedside, and yet don't guess why I suffer so wildly, don't even guess</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at the only remedy there is for me. She is not here," he whispered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wildly, seizing Raisky by the shoulders and shaking him violently. "She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is not here, and that is what constitutes my illness. Besides, I am not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ill, I am dead. Take me to her, and I shall rise again. And you ask</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whether I will take her back again! You, a novelist, don't understand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>simple things like that!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I did not know that you loved her like that," said Raisky tenderly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You used to laugh and say that you had got so used to her that you were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>becoming faithless to your Greeks and Romans."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I chattered, I boasted," laughed Leonti bitterly, "and was without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understanding. But for this I never should have understood. I thought I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loved the ancients, while my whole love was given to the living woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Yes, Boris, I loved books and my gymnasium, the ancients and the moderns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my scholars, and you, Boris; I loved the street, this hedge, the service</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tree there, only through my love for her. Now, nothing of all this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>matters. I knew that as I lay on the floor reading her letter. And you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ask whether I would receive her. God in Heaven! If she came, how she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should be cherished!" he concluded, his tears flowing once more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Leonti, I come to you with a request from Tatiana Markovna, who asks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you," he went on, though Leonti walked ceaselessly up and down, dragging</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his slippers and appeared not to listen, "to come over to us. Here you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will die of misery."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank you," said Leonti, shaking his head. "She is a saint. But how can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a desolate man carry his sorrow into a strange house?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not a strange house, Leonti, we are brothers, and our relation is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>closer than the ties of blood."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti lay down on the bed, and took Raisky's hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pardon my egoism," he said. "Later, later, I will come of my own accord,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will ask permission to look after your library, if no hope is left me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you any hope?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What! Do you think there is no hope?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, who did not wish to deprive his friend of the last straw, nor to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stir useless hope in him, hesitated, before he answered after a pause:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't know what to say to you exactly, Leonti. I know so little of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your wife that I cannot judge her character."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You know her," said Leonti in a dull voice. "It was you who directed my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>attention to the Frenchman, but then I did not understand you, because</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing of the kind had entered my head. But if he leaves her," he said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a gleam of hope in his eyes, "she will perhaps remember me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Perhaps," said Raisky. "To-morrow I will come to fetch you. Good-bye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the present. To-night I will either come myself or send someone who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will stay with you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti did not hear, and did not even see Raisky go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he reached home, Raisky gave his aunt an account of Leonti's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>condition, telling her that there was no danger, but that no sympathy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would help matters. Yakob was sent to look after the sick man and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna did not forget to send an abundant supper, with tea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rum, wine and all sorts of other things.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are these things for, Grandmother?" asked Raisky. "He doesn't eat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anything."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But the other one, if he returns?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What other one?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who but Markushka? He will want something to eat. You found him with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>our invalid."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will go to Mark, Granny, and tell him what you say."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For goodness' sake don't do that, Borushka. Mark will laugh at me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, he will be grateful and respectful, for he understands you. He is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not like Niel Andreevich."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't want his gratitude and respect. Let him eat, and be satisfied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and God be with him. He is a ruined man. Has he remembered the eighty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roubles?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXI</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky laughed as he went out into the garden. He looked sadly at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>closed shutters of the old house, and stood for a long time on the edge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the precipice, looking down thoughtfully into the depths of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thicket and the trees rustling and cracking in the wind. Then he turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to look at the long avenues, here forming gloomy corridors, and then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opening out into open stately spaces, at the flower gardens now fading</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>under the approach of autumn, at the kitchen garden, and at the distant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glimmer of the rising moon, and at the stars. He looked out over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volga, gleaming like steel in the distance. The evening was fresh and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cool, and the withered leaves were falling with a gentle rustle around</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him. He could not take his eyes from the river, now silvered by the moon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which separated him from Vera. She had gone without leaving a word for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him. A word from her would have brought tenderness and would have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drowned all bitterness, he thought. But she was gone without leaving a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trace or any kind remembrance. With bent head and full of anxious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought he made his way along the dark avenues.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Suddenly delicate fingers seized his shoulders, and he heard a low laugh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera!" he cried, seizing her hand violently. "You here, and not away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over the Volga!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, here, not over there." She put her arm in his and asked him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>laughing, whether he thought she would let him go without saying good-bye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Witch!" he said, not knowing whether fear or joy was uppermost. "I was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this very moment complaining that you had not left a line for me, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now I can't understand, as everyone in the house told me you had gone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away yesterday."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you believed it," she said laughing. "I told them to say so, to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surprise you. They were humbugging.... To go away without two words,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she asked triumphantly, "or to stay, which is better?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her gay talk, her quick gestures, the mockery in her voice, all these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things seemed unnatural, and he recognised beneath it all weariness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strain, an effort to conceal the collapse of her strength. When they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reached the end of the avenue he tried to lead her to an open spot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where he could see her face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let me look at you! How gay and merry you are, Vera!" he said timidly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is there to see?" she interrupted impatiently, and tried to draw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him into the shadow again. He felt that her hands were trembling, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the moment his own passion was stilled, and he shared her suffering.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do you look at me like that? I am not crazy," she said, turning her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He was stricken with horror. The insane are always assuring everyone of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their sanity. What was wrong with Vera? She did not confide in him, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would not speak out, she was determined to fight her own battles. Who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>could support and shelter her? An inner voice told him that Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna alone could do it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera, you are ill," he said earnestly. "Give Grandmother your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>confidence."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Silence! Not a word of Grandmother! Goodbye! To-morrow we will go for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stroll, do some shopping, go down by the river, anything you like."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will go away, Vera," he cried, filled with inexpressible fear. "I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>worn out. Why do you deceive me? Why did you call me back to find you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>still here? Was it to mock my sufferings?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So that we could suffer together," she answered. "Passion is beautiful,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as you yourself have said; it is life itself. You have taught me how to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>love, have educated passion in me, and now you may admire the result of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your labour," she ended, drawing in a deep breath of the cool evening</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I warned you, Vera. I told you passion was a fierce wolf."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, worse, it is a tiger. I could not believe what you said, but I do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now. Do you know the picture in the old house which represents a tiger</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>showing his teeth at a seated Cupid? I never understood the picture,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which seemed meaningless, but now I understand it. Passion is a tiger,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lying there apparently so peaceful and inviting, until he begins to howl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and to whet his teeth."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky pursued the comparison in the hope that he might learn the name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Vera's lover.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your comparison is false, Vera. There are no tigers in our Northern</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>climate. I am nearer the mark when I compare passion to a wolf."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are right," she said with a nervous laugh. "A real wolf. However</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carefully you feed him he looks always to the woods. You are all wolves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and _he_, too, is a wolf."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who?" he asked in an expressionless voice. "Tushin is a bear, a genuine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Russian bear. You may lay your hand on his shaggy head, and sleep; your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rest is sure, for he will serve you all his life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Which of the animals am I?" he asked gaily, noting that Tushin was not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the man. "Don't beat about the bush, Vera, you may say I am an ass."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No," she said scornfully. "You are a fox, a nice, cunning fox, with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gift for deception. That's what you are. Why don't you say something?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she went on, as he kept an embarrassed silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera, there are weapons to be used against wolves, for me, to go away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for you, not to go down there," he said, pointing to the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tell me how to prevent myself from going there. Teach me, since you are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my mentor, how not to go. You first set the house on fire, and then talk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of leaving it. You sing in praise of passion, and then...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I meant another kind of passion. Where both parties to it are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>honourable, it means the supreme happiness in life, and its storms are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>full of the glow of life...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And where there is no dishonour, no precipice yawns? I love, and am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loved, yet passion has me in its jaws. Tell me what I should do."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Confess all to Grandmother," whispered Raisky, pale with terror, "or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>permit me to talk to her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To shame me and ruin me? Who told me I need not obey her?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"At one moment you are on the point of telling your secret, at another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you hide behind it. I am in the dark, and feel my way in uncertainty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>How can I, when I do not know the whole truth, diagnose the case?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You know what is wrong with me? Why do you say you are in the dark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Come," she said, leading him into the moonlight. "See what is wrong with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He stood transfixed with terror and pity. Pale, haggard, with wild eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and tightly pressed lips, this was quite another Vera. Strands of hair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were loose from beneath her hood, and fell in gipsy-like confusion over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her forehead and temples, and covered her eyes and mouth with every</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quick movement she made. Her shoulders were negligently clad in a satin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wrap trimmed with swansdown, held in place by a loosely tied knot of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well," she said, shaking her hair out of her eyes. "What has happened</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the beauty whose praise you sang?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera," he said, "I would die for you. Tell me how I may serve you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Die!" she exclaimed. "Help me to live. Give me that beautiful passion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which sheds its glorious light over the whole of life. I see no passion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but this drowning tiger passion. Give me back at least my old strength,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you, who talk of going to my Grandmother to place her and me on the same</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bier. It is too late to tell me to go no more to the precipice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She sat down on the bench and looked moodily straight before her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You yourself, Vera, dreamed of freedom, and you prided yourself on your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>independence."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My head burns. Have pity on your sister! I am ashamed to be so weak."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is it, dear Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nothing. Take me home, help me to mount the steps. I am afraid, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would like to lie down. Pardon me for having disturbed you for nothing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for having brought you here. You would have gone away and forgotten me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I am only feverish. Are you angry with me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Too dejected to reply, he gave her his arm, took her as far as her room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and struck a light.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Send Marina or Masha to stay in my room, please. But say nothing to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother, lest she should be alarmed and come herself. Why are you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking at me so strangely? God knows what I have been saying to you, to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>plague you and to avenge myself of all my humiliations. Tell Grandmother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that I have gone to bed to be up early in the morning, and I pray you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bless me in your thoughts, do you hear?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I hear," he said absently, as he pressed her hand and went out in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>search of Masha.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked forward with anxiety to Vera's awakening. He seemed to have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forgotten his own passion since his imagination had become absorbed in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the contemplation of her suffering.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Something is wrong with Vera," said Tatiana Markovna, shaking her grey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head as she saw how grimly he avoided her questioning glance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What can it be?" asked Raisky negligently, with an effort to assume</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indifference.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Something is wrong, Borushka. She looks so melancholy and is so silent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and often seems to have tears in her eyes. I have spoken to the doctor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but he only talks the old nonsense about nerves," she said, relapsing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into a gloomy silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky looked anxiously for Vera's appearance next morning. She came at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>last, accompanied by the maid, who carried a warm coat and her hat and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shoes. She said good morning to her aunt, asked for coffee, ate her roll</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with appetite, and reminded Raisky that he had promised to go shopping</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with her in the town and to take a walk in the park. It amazed him that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she should be once more transformed, but there was a certain audacity in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her gestures and a haste in her speech which seemed forced and alien</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from her usual manner and reminded him of her behaviour the day before.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She was plainly making a great effort to conceal her real mood. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chatted volubly with Paulina Karpovna, who had turned up unexpectedly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and was displaying the pattern of a dress intended for Marfinka's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trousseau. That lady's visit was really directed towards Raisky, of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whose return she had heard. She sought in vain an occasion to speak with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him alone, but seized a moment to sit down beside him, when she made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes at him and said in a low voice: _"Je comprends; dites tout, du</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>courage."_</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky wished her anywhere, and moved away. Vera meanwhile put on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coat and asked him to come with her. Paulina Karpovna wished to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accompany them, but Vera declined on the ground that they were walking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and had far to go, that the ground was damp, and that Paulina's elegant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dress with a long train was unsuited for the expedition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I want to have you this whole day for myself," she said to Raisky as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they went out together, "indeed every day until you go."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But, Vera, how can I help you when I don't know what is making you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffer. I only see that you have your own drama, that the catastrophe is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>approaching, or is in process. What is it?" he asked anxiously, as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shivered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't feel well, and am far from gay. Autumn is beginning. Nature</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grows dark and sinister, the birds are already deserting us, and my mood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>too, is autumnal. Do you see the black line high above the Volga? Those</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are the cranes in flight. My thoughts, too, fly away into the distance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She realised halfway that this strange explanation was unconvincing, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only pursued it because she did not wish to tell the truth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I wanted to ask you, Vera, about the letters you wrote to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am ill and weak; you saw what an attack I had yesterday. I cannot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remember just now all that I wrote."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Another time then!" he sighed. "But tell me, Vera, how I can help you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Why do you keep me back, and why do you want to spend these days in my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>society? I have a right to ask this, and it is your duty to give a plain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>answer unless you want me to think you false."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't let us talk of it now."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No," he cried angrily. "You play with me as a cat does with a mouse. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will endure it no longer. You can either reveal your own secrets or keep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them as you please, but in so far as it touches me, I demand an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>immediate answer. What is my part in this drama?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not be angry! I did not keep you back to wound you. But don't talk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about it, don't agitate me so that I have another attack like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yesterday's. You see that I can hardly stand. I don't want my weakness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to be seen at home. Defend me from myself. Come to me at dusk, about six,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and I will tell you why I detained you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pardon me, Vera. I am not myself either," he said, struck by her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffering. "I don't know what lies on your heart, and I will not ask. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will come later to fetch you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will tell you if I have the strength," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They went into the shops, where Vera made purchases for herself and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka, she talked eagerly to the acquaintances they met, and even</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>visited a poor godchild, for whom she took gifts. She assented readily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Raisky's suggestion that they should visit Koslov.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When they reached the house, Mark walked out of the door. He was plainly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>startled, made no answer to Raisky's inquiry after Leonti's health, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>walked quickly away. Vera was still more disconcerted but pulled herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>together, and followed Raisky into the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the matter with him?" asked Raisky. "He did not answer a word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but simply bolted. You were frightened, too, Vera. Is it Mark who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>signalises his presence at the foot of the precipice by a shot? I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seen him wandering round with a gun," he said joking.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She answered in the same tone: "Of course, Cousin," but she did not look</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>No, thought Raisky to himself, she could not have taken for her idol a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wandering, ragged gipsy like that. Then he wondered whether the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>possibility could be entirely excluded, since passion wanders where he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lists, and not in obedience to the convictions and dictates of man. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is invincible, and master of his own inexplicable moods. But Vera had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never had any opportunity of meeting Mark, he concluded, and was merely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afraid of him as every one else was.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti's condition was unchanged. He wandered about like a drunken man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silent and listening for the noise of any carriage in the street, when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he would rush to the window to look if it bore his fugitive wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He would come to them in a few weeks, he said, after Marfinka's wedding,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as Vera suggested. Then he became aware of Vera's presence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera Vassilievna!" he cried in surprise, staring at her as he addressed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky. "Do you know, Boris Pavlovich, who else has read your books and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>helped me to arrange them?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who has been reading my books?" asked Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But Leonti had been distracted by the sound of a passing carriage and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not hear the question. Vera whispered to Raisky that they should go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I wanted to say something, Boris Pavlovich," said Leonti thoughtfully,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>raising his head, "but I can't remember what."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You said some one else had been reading my books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti pointed to Vera, who was looking out of the window, but who now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pulled Raisky's sleeve "Come!" she said and they left the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When they reached home Vera made over some of her purchases to her aunt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and had others taken to her room. She asked Raisky to go out with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>again in the park and down by the Volga.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why are you tiring yourself out, Vera?" he asked, as they went. "You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are weak."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Air, I must have air!" she exclaimed, turning her face to the wind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She is collecting all her strength, he thought, as they entered the room</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where the family was waiting for them for dinner. In the afternoon he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slept for weariness, and only awoke at twilight, when six o'clock had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>already struck. He went to find Vera, but Marina told him she had gone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to vespers, she did not know whether in the village church on the hill</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or in the church on the outskirts of the town. He went to the town</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>church first, and after studying the faces of all the old women</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>assembled there, he climbed the hill to the village church. Old people</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stood in the corners and by the door, and by a pillar in a dark corner</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knelt Vera, with a veil wrapped round her bowed head. He took his stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>near her, behind another pillar, and, engrossed in his thoughts of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>state of mind, watched her intently as she prayed motionless, with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes fixed on the cross. He went sadly into the porch to wait for her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and there she joined him, putting her hand in his arm without a word.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As they crossed the big meadow into the park he thought of nothing but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the promised explanation. His own intense desire to be freed from his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>miserable uncertainty weighed with him less than his duty, as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conceived it, of shielding her, of illuminating her path with his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>experience, and of lending his undivided strength to keep her from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>overstepping her moral precipice. Perhaps it was merely a remnant of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pride that prevented her from telling him why she had summoned him and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>detained him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He could not, and, even if he could, he had not the right to share his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>apprehensions with anyone else. Even if he might confide in Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna, if he spoke to her of his suspicion and his surmises, he was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not clear that it would help matters, for he feared that their aunt's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>practical, but old-fashioned wisdom would be shattered on Vera's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>obstinacy. Vera possessed the bolder mind, the quicker will. She was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>level with contemporary thought, and towered above the society in which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she moved. She must have derived her ideas and her knowledge from some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>source accessible to her alone. Though she took pains to conceal her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knowledge, it was betrayed by a chance word, by the mention of a name or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an authority in this or that sphere of learning, and it was betrayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>also in her speech; in the remarkable aptness of the words in which she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>clothed her thoughts and feelings. In this matter she held so great an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>advantage over Tatiana Markovna that the old lady's efforts in argument</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were more likely to be disastrous than not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Undoubtedly Tatiana Markovna was a wise woman with a correct judgment of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the general phenomena of life. She was a famous housewife, ruling her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>little tsardom magnificently; she knew the ways, the vices and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>virtues of mankind as they are set out in the Ten Commandments and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Gospels, but she knew nothing of the life where the passions rage and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>steep everything in their colours. And even if she had known such a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>world in her youth it must have been passion divorced from experience,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an unshared passion, or one stifled in its development, not a stormy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drama of love, but rather a lyric tenderness which unfolded and perished</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without leaving a trace on her pure life. How could she lend a rescuing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hand to snatch Vera from the precipice, she who had no faith in passion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but had merely sought to understand facts?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The shots in the depths of the precipice, and Vera's expeditions were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indeed facts, against which Tatiana Markovna might be able to adopt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>measures. She might double the watch kept on the property, set men to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>watch for the lover, while Vera, shut up in the house, endured</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>humiliation and a fresh kind of suffering.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera would not endure any such rough constraint, and would make her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>escape, just as she had fled across the Volga from Raisky. These would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be, in fact, no means at all, for she had outgrown Tatiana Markovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>circle of experience and morals. No, authority might serve with Marfinka,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but not with the clear-headed, independent Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Such were Raisky's thoughts as he walked silently by Vera's side, no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>longer desiring full knowledge for his own sake, but for her salvation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Perhaps, he thought, he would best gain his end by indirect efforts to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>make her betray herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Leonti said," he began, "that you have been reading books out of my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>library. Did you read them with him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Sometimes he told me of the contents of certain books; others I read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the priest, Natasha's husband."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What books did you read with the priest?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For the moment I don't remember, but he read the writings of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Fathers, for instance, and explained them to Natasha and me, to my great</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>advantage. We also read with him Voltaire and Spinoza. Why do you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>laugh?" she asked, looking at Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There seems a remarkable gap between the Fathers and Spinoza and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Voltaire. The EncyclopФdists are also included in my library. Did you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>read them?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nikolai Ivanovich read some to us, and talked about others."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Did you also occupy yourselves with Feuerbach, with the Socialists and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Materialists?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Natasha's husband asked us to copy out passages, which he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indicated by pencil marks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What was his object in this?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I think he was preparing to publish a refutation."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where did you obtain the newer books that are not in my library?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Not the exile," he suggested as she gave no answer, "who lives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here under police supervision, the same man about whom you wrote</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to me? But you are not listening."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, I am. Who gave me the books? Sometimes one person, sometimes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another here in the town."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Volokov borrowed these books."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Perhaps so, I had them from professors."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The thought flashed through Raisky's head that there might be other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>professors of the same kind as Monsieur Charles. But he merely asked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what were the views of Nikolai Ivanovich on Spinoza and these other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>writers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He says." replied Vera, "that these writings are the efforts of bold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>minds to evade the truth; they have beaten out for themselves side paths</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which must in the end unite with the main road. He says too, that all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these attempts serve the cause of truth, in that the truth shines out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with greater splendour in the end."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But he does not tell you where truth lies?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>By way of answer she pointed to the little chapel now in sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you think he is right?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't think, I believe. And don't you also believe he is right."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He agreed, and she asked him why, that being so, he had asked her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I wanted," he said, "to know your opinion."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But you have often seen me at prayer," said Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, but I do not overhear your prayers. Do you pray for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alleviation of the restless sorrow that afflicts your mind?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They had reached the chapel, and Vera stood still for a moment. She did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not appear to have heard his question, and she answered only with a deep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sigh. It was growing dark as they retraced their steps, Vera's growing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slower and more uncertain as they approached the old house, where she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stood still and glanced in the direction of the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To still the storm I must not go near the precipice, you say--I beg of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you to stand by me, for I am sick and helpless."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will not Grandmother know better how to help you, Vera? Confide in her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a woman, who will perhaps understand your pain."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She shook her head. "I will tell you, Grandmother and you, but not now;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now I cannot. And yet I beg of you not to leave me, not to allow me out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of your sight. If a shot summons me, keep me away from the precipice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and, if necessary, hold me back by force. Things are as bad as that with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me. That is all you can do for me. That is why I asked you not to go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away, because I felt that my strength is failing, because except you I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have no one to help me, for Grandmother would not understand. Forgive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You did right, Vera," he replied, deeply moved. "Depend on me. I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>willing to stay here for ever, if that will bring you peace."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, in a week's time the shots will cease."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She dried her eyes, and pressed his hand; then with slow, uneven steps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>supporting herself by the balustrade she passed up the steps and into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Two days had passed, and Raisky had had small opportunity of seeing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera alone, though she came to dinner and to tea, and spoke of ordinary</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things. Raisky turned once more to his novel, or rather to the plan of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it. He visited Leonti, and did not neglect the Governor and other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friends. But in order to keep watch on Vera he wandered about the park</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the garden. Two days were now gone, he thought, since he sat on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bench by the precipice, but there were still five days of danger.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's birthday lay two days' ahead, and on that day Vera would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly leave the family circle. On the next Marfinka was to go with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fiancИ and his mother to Kolchino, and Vera would not be likely to leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna alone. By that time the week would be over and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>threatening clouds dispersed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After dinner Vera asked him to come over to her in the evening, as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wished him to undertake a commission for her. When he arrived she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suggested a walk, and, as she chose the direction of the fields he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>realised that she wished to go to the chapel, and took the field path</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accordingly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As she crossed the threshold, she looked up at the thoughtful face of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Christ.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have sought more powerful aid than mine," said Raisky. "Moreover,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you will not now go there without me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She nodded in assent. She seemed to be seeking strength, sympathy and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>support from the glance of the Crucified, but His eyes kept their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expression of quiet thought and detachment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When she turned her eyes from the picture she reiterated, "I will not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>go." Raisky read on her face neither prayer nor desire; it wore an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expression of weariness, indifference and submission.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He suggested that they should return, and reminded her that she had a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>commission for him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will you take the bouquet-holder that I chose the other week for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's birthday to the goldsmith?" she said, handing him her purse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I gave him some pearls to set in it, and her name should be engraved.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And could you be up as early as eight o'clock on her birthday?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Of course. If necessary, I can stay up all night!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have already spoken to the gardener, who owns the big orangery. Would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you choose me a nice bouquet and send it to me. I have confidence in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your taste."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your confidence in me makes progress, Vera," he laughed. "You already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trust my taste and my honour."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I would have seen to all this myself," she went on, "but I have not the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Next day Raisky took the bouquet holder, and discussed the arrangement</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the flowers with the gardener. He himself bought for Marfinka an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>elegant watch and chain, with two hundred roubles which he borrowed from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tiet Nikonich, for Tatiana Markovna would not have given him so much</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>money for the purpose, and would have betrayed the secret. In Tiet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikonich's room he found a dressing table decked with muslin and lace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a mirror encased in a china frame of flowers and Cupids, a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beautiful specimen of SХvres work.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where did you get this treasure?" cried Raisky, who could not take his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes from the thing. "What a lovely piece!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is my gift for Marfa Vassilievna," said Tiet Nikonich with his kind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>smile. "I am glad it pleases you, for you are a connoisseur. Your liking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for it assures me that the dear birthday child will appreciate it as a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wedding gift. She is a lovely girl, just like these roses. The Cupids</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will smile when they see her charming face in the mirror. Please don't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell Tatiana Markovna of my secret."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"This beautiful piece must have cost over two thousand roubles, and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cannot possibly have bought it here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My Grandfather gave five thousand roubles for it, and it was part of my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mother's house-furnishing and until now it stood in her bedroom, left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>untouched in my birth-place. I had it brought here last month, and to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>make sure it should not be broken, six men carried it in alternate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shifts for the whole hundred and fifty versts. I had a new muslin cover</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made, but the lace is old; you will notice how yellow it is. Ladies like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these things, although they don't matter to us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What will Grandmother say?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There will be a storm. I do feel rather uneasy about it, but perhaps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she will forgive me. I may tell you, Boris Pavlovich, that I love both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the girls, as if they were my own daughters. I held them on my knee as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>babies, and with Tatiana Markovna gave them their first lessons. I tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you in confidence that I have also arranged a wedding present for Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna which I hope she will like when the time comes." He showed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky a magnificent antique silver dinner service of fine workmanship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for twelve persons. "I may confess to you, as you are her cousin, that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in agreement with Tatiana Markovna I have a splendid and a rich marriage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in view for her, for whom nothing can be too good. The finest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>_partie_ in this neighbourhood," he said in a confidential tone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"is Ivan Ivanovich Tushin, who is absolutely devoted to her, as he well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>may be."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky repressed a sigh and went home where he found Vikentev and his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mother, who had arrived for Marfinka's birthday, with Paulina Karpovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and other guests from the town, who stayed until nearly seven o'clock.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna and Marfa Egorovna carried on an interminable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conversation about Marfinka's trousseau and house furnishing. The lovers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went into the garden, and from there to the village. Vikentev carrying a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>parcel which he threw in the air and caught again as he walked. Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>entered every house, said good-bye to the women, and caressed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>children. In two cases she washed the children's faces, she distributed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>calico for shirts and dresses, and told two elder children to whom she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>presented shoes that it was time they gave up paddling in the puddles.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God reward you, our lovely mistress, Angel of God!" cried the women in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>every yard as she bade them farewell for a fortnight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the evening the house was aglow with light. Tatiana Markovna could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not do enough in honour of her guest and future connexion. She had a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>great bed put up in the guest-chamber, that nearly reached to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ceiling and resembled a catafalque. Marfinka and Vikentev gave full rein</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to their gay humour, as they played and sang. Only Raisky's windows were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dark. He had gone out immediately after dinner and had not returned to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tea.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The moon illuminated the new house but left the old house in shadow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There was bustle in the yard, in the kitchen, and in the servants' rooms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where Marfa Egorovna's coachman and servants were being entertained.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>From seven o'clock onwards Vera had sat idle in the dusk by the feeble</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>light of a candle, her head supported on her hand, leaning over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table, while with her other hand she turned over the leaves of a book at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which she hardly glanced. She was protected from the cold autumn air</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from the open window, by a big white woollen shawl thrown round her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shoulders. She stood up after a time, laid the book on the table, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went to the window. She looked towards the sky, and then at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gaily-lighted house opposite. She shivered, and was about to shut the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>window when the report of a gun rolled up from the park through the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quiet dusk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She shuddered, and seemed to have lost the use of her limbs, then sank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into a chair and bowed her head. When she rose and looked wildly round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her face had changed. Sheer fright and distress looked from her eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Again and again she passed her hand over her forehead, and sat down at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the table, only to jump up again. She tore the shawl from her shoulders</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and threw it on the bed; then with nervous haste she opened and shut the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cupboard; she looked on the divan, on the chairs, for something she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>apparently could not find, and then collapsed wearily on her chair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On the back of the chair hung a wrap, a gift from Tiet Nikonich. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seized it and threw it over her head, rushed to the wardrobe, hunted in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it with feverish haste, taking out first one coat, then another, until</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had nearly emptied the cupboard and dresses and cloaks lay in a heap</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the floor. At last she found something warm and dark, put out the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>light, and went noiselessly down the steps into the open. She crossed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the yard, hidden in the shadows, and took her way along the dark avenue.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She did not walk, she flew; and when she crossed the open light patches</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her shadow was hardly visible for a moment, as if the moon had not time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to catch the flying figure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When she reached the end of the avenue, by the ditch which divided the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>garden from the park, she stopped a moment to get her breath. Then she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crossed the park, hurried through the bushes, past her favourite bench,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and reached the precipice. She picked up her skirts for the descent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when suddenly, as if he had risen out of the ground, Raisky stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>between her and her goal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where are you going, Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go back," he said, offering his hand, but she tried to push past him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera, where are you going?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is for the last time." she said in a pleading, shamed whisper. "I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must say good-bye. Make way for me, Cousin! I will return in a moment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Wait for me here, on this bench."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Without replying, he took her firmly by the hand, and she struggled in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vain to free herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let me go! You are hurting me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But he did not give way, and the struggle proceeded.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will not hold me by force," she cried, and with unnatural strength</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>freed herself, and sought to dash past him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>But he put his arm round her waist, took her to the bench, and sat down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beside her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How rough and rude!" she cried.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot hold you back by force, Vera. I may be saving you from ruin."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Can I be ruined against my own will?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is against your will; yet you go to your ruin."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is no question of ruin. We must see one another again in order to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>separate."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is not necessary to see one another in order to separate."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I must, and will. An hour or a day later, it is all the same. You may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>call the servants, the whole town, a file of soldiers, but no power will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>keep me back."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A second shot resounded.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She pulled herself up, but was pressed down on the bench with the weight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Raisky's hands. She shook her head wildly in powerless rage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What reward do you hope from me for this virtuous deed?" she hissed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He said nothing, but kept a watchful eye on her movements. After a time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she besought him gently: "Let me go, Cousin," but he refused.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Cousin," she said, laying her hand gently on his shoulder. "Imagine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that you sat upon hot coals, and were dying every minute of terror, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of wild impatience, that happiness rose before you, stretching out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enticing arms, only to vanish, that your whole being rose to meet it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>imagine that you saw before you a last hope, a last glimmer. That is how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it is with me at this moment. The moment will be lost, and with it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everything else."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Think, Vera, if in the hot thirst of fever you ask for ice, it is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>denied you. In your soberer moments yesterday you pointed out to me the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>practical means of rescue, you said I was not to let you go, and I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She fell on her knees before him, and wrung her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I should curse you my whole life long for your violence. Give way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Perhaps it is my destiny that calls me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I was a witness yesterday, Vera, of where you seek your fate. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>believe in a Providence, and there is no other destiny."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes," she answered submissively. "I do believe. There before the sacred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>picture I sought for a spark to lighten my path, but in vain. What shall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I do?" she said, rising.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not go, Vera."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Perhaps it is my destiny that sends me there, there where my presence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>may be needed. Don't try any longer to keep me, for I have made up my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mind. My weakness is gone, and I have recovered control of myself and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feel I am strong. It is not my destiny alone, but the destiny of another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>human being that is to be decided down there. Between me and him you are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>digging an abyss, and the responsibility will rest upon you. I shall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never be consoled, and shall accuse you of having destroyed our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness. Do not hold me back. You can only do it out of egoism, out of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>jealousy. You lied when you spoke to me of freedom."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I hear the voice of passion, Vera, with all its sophistry and its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deviations. You are practising the arts of a Jesuit. Remember that you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself bade me, only yesterday, not to leave you. Will you curse me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for not yielding to you? On whom does the responsibility rest? Tell me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who the man is?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I tell you will you promise not to keep me back?" she said quickly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't know. Perhaps."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Give me your word not to keep me any longer, and I give the name."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Another shot rang out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She sprang to one side, before he had time to take her by the hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go to Grandmother," he commanded, adding gently, "Tell her your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trouble."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For Christ's sake let me go. I ask for alms like a beggar. I must be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>free! I take him to whom I prayed yesterday to witness that I am going</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the last time. Do you hear? I will not break my oath. Wait here for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me. I will return immediately, will only say farewell to the 'Wolf,'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will hear a word from him, and perhaps he will yield!" She rushed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forward, fell to the ground in her haste, and tried in vain to rise. Tom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by an unutterable pity, Raisky took no heed of his own suffering, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>raised her in his arms and bore her down the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The path is so steep here that you would fall again," he whispered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Presently he set her down on the path, and she stooped to kiss his hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are generous, Cousin. Vera will not forget."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>With that she hurried into the thicket, jubilant as a bird set free from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his cage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky heard the rustle of the bushes as she pushed them aside, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crackle of the dry twigs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the half-ruined arbour waited Mark, with gun and cap laid upon the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table. He walked up and down on the shaky floor, and whenever he trod on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one end of a board the other rose in the air, and then fell clattering</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The devil's music!" he murmured angrily, sat down on a bench near the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table, and pushed his hands through his thick hair. He smoked one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cigarette after another, the burning match lighting up his pale,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>agitated face for a moment. After each shot he listened for a few</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>minutes, went out on the steps, and looked out into the bushes. When he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>returned he walked up and down, raising the "devil's music" once more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>threw himself on the bench, and ran his hands through his hair. After</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the third shot he listened long and earnestly. As he heard nothing he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was on the point of going away. To relieve his gloomy feelings he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>murmured a curse between his teeth, took the gun and prepared to descend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the path. He hesitated a few moments longer, then walked off with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>decision. Suddenly he met Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She stood still, breathing with difficulty, and laid her hand on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart. As soon as he took her hand she was calm. Mark could not conceal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his joy, but his words of greeting did not betray it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You used to be punctual, Vera," he said, "and I used not to have to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>waste three shots."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A reproach instead of a welcome!" she said, drawing her hand away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It's only by way of beginning a conversation Happiness makes a fool of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me, like Raisky."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If happiness gleamed before us, we should not be meeting in secret by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this precipice," she said, drawing a long breath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We should be sitting at your Grandmother's tea-table, and waiting till</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>someone arranged our betrothal. Why dream of these impossible things.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Your Grandmother would not give you to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She would. She does what I wish. That is not the hindrance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are starting on this endless polemic again, Vera. We are meeting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the last time, as you determined we should. Let us make an end of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this torture."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I took an oath never to come here again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Meanwhile, the time is precious. We are parting for ever, if stupidity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>commands, if your Grandmother's antiquated convictions separate us. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leave here a week from now. As you know the document assuring my freedom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>has arrived. Let us be together, and not be separated again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Never?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Never!" he repeated angrily, with a gesture of impatience. "What lying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>words those are, 'never' and 'always.' Of course 'never.' Does not a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>year, perhaps two, three years, mean never? You want a never ending</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tenderness. Does such a thing exist?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Enough, Mark! I have heard enough of this temporary affection. Ah! I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>very unhappy. The separation from you is not the only cloud over my soul.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>For a year now I have been hiding myself from my Grandmother, which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>oppresses me, and her still more. I hoped that in these days my trouble</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would end; we should put our thoughts, our hopes, our intentions on a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>clear footing. Then I would go to Grandmother and say: 'This is what I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have chosen for my whole life.' But it is not to be, and we are to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>part?" she asked sadly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I conceived myself to be an angel," said Mark, "I might say 'for our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole lives,' and you would be justified. That gray-headed dreamer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, also thinks that women are created for a higher purpose."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"They are created above all for the family. They are not angels, neither</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are they, most certainly, mere animals. I am no wolf's mate, Mark, but a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For the family, yes. But is that any hindrance for us. You want</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>draperies, for fine feeling, sympathies and the rest of the stuff are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing but draperies, like those famous leaves with which, it is said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>human beings covered themselves in Paradise."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Mark, human beings!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark smiled sarcastically, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"They may be draperies," continued Vera, "but they also, according to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your own teaching, are given by nature. What, I ask, is it that attaches</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you to me? You say you love me. You have altered, grown thinner. Is it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not, by your conception of love, a matter of indifference whether you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>choose a companion in me, or from the poor quarter of our town, or from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a village on the Volga. What has induced you to come down here for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole year?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Examine your own fallacy, Vera," he said, looking at her gloomily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Love is not a concept merely, but a driving force, a necessity, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>therefore is mostly blind. But I am not blindly chained to you. Your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>extraordinary beauty, your intellect and your free outlook hold me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>longer in thrall than would be possible with any other woman."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Very flattering!" she said in a low, pained voice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"These ideas of yours, Vera, will bring us to disaster. But for them we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should for long have been united and happy."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Happy for a time. And then a new driving force will appear on the scene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the stage will be cleared, and so on."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The responsibility is not ours. Nature has ordered it so, and rightly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Can we alter Nature, in order to live on concepts?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"These concepts are essential principles. You have said yourself that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nature has her laws, and human beings their principles."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is where the germ of disintegration lies, in that men want to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>formulate principles from the driving force of Nature, and thus to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hamper themselves hand and foot. Love is happiness, which Nature has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conferred on man. That is my view."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The happiness of which you speak," said Vera, rising, "has as its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>complement, duty. That is my view."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How fantastic! Forget your duty, Vera, and acquiesce in the fact that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>love is a driving force of Nature, often an uncontrollable one." Then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>standing up to her embraced her, saying, "Is that not so, you most</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>obstinate, beautiful and wisest of women?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, duty," she said haughtily, disengaging herself. "For the years of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness retribution will be exacted."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How? In making soup, nursing one another, looking at one another and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pretending, in harping on principles, as we ourselves fade? If one half</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>falls ill and retrogresses, shall the other who is strong, who hears the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>call of life, allow himself to be held back by duty?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes. In that case he must not listen to the calls that come to him; he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must, to use Grandmother's expression, avoid the voice as he would the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brandy bottle. That is how I understand happiness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your case must be a bad one if it has to be bolstered up by quotations</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from your Grandmother's wisdom. Tell me how firmly your principles are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rooted."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will go to her to-day direct from here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To tell her what?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To tell her what there is between us, all that she does not know," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said, sitting down on the bench again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You don't understand, because you don't know what duty means. I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been guilty before her for a long time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is the morality which smothers life with mould and dulness. Vera,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera, you don't love, you do not know how!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You ought not to speak like that, unless you wish to drive me to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>despair. Am I to think that there is deception in your past, that you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>want to ruin me when you do not love me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no, Vera," he said, rising hastily to his feet. "If I had wanted to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deceive you I could have done so long ago."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a desperate war you wage against yourself, Mark, and how you ruin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your own life!" she cried, wringing her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let us cease to quarrel, Vera. Your Grandmother speaks through you, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with another voice. That was all very well once, but now we are in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flood of another life where neither authority nor preconceived ideas</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will help us, where truth alone asserts her power."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is truth?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In happiness, in the joy of love. And I love you. Why do you torture me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Why do you fight against me and against yourself, and make two victims?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is a strange reproach. Look at me. It is only a few days since we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saw one another, and have I not changed?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I see that you suffer, and that makes it the more senseless. Now, I too</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ask what has induced you to come down here for all this time?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because I had not earlier realised the horror of my position, you will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>say," she said, with a look that was almost hostile. "We might have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked one another this question, and made this reproach, long ago, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>might have ceased to meet here. Better late than never! To-day we must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>answer the question, What is it that we wanted and expected from one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here is my irrefragable opinion--I want your love, and I give you mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In love I recognise solely the principle of reciprocation, as it obtains</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in Nature. The law that I acknowledge is to follow unfettered our strong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>impression, to exchange happiness for happiness. This answers your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>question of why I came here. Is sacrifice necessary? Call it what you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will there is no sacrifice in my scheme of life. I will no longer wander</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in this morass, and don't understand how I have wasted my strength so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>long, certainly not for your sake, but essentially for my own. Here I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will stay so long as I am happy, so long as I love. If my love grows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cold, I shall tell you so, and go wherever Life leads me, without taking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>any baggage of duties and privileges with me; those I leave here in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>depths below the precipice. You see, Vera, I don't deceive you, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>speak frankly. Naturally you possess the same rights as I. The mob above</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there lies to itself and others, and calls these his principles. But in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>secret and by cunning it acts in the same way, and only lays its ban on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the women. Between us there must be equality. Is that fair or not?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Sophistry!" she said, shaking her head. "You know my principles, Mark."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To hang like stones round one another's necks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Love imposes duties, just as life demands them. If you had an old,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blind mother you would maintain and support her, would remain by her. An</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>honourable man holds it to be his duty and his pleasure too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You philosophise, Vera, but you do not love."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You avoid my argument, Mark. I speak my opinion plainly, for I am a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman, not an animal, or a machine."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your love is the fantastic, elaborate type described in novels. Is what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you ask of me honourable? Against my convictions I am to go into a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>church, to submit to a ceremony which has no meaning for me. I don't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>believe any of it and can't endure the parson. Should I be acting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>logically or honourably?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera hastily wrapped herself in her mantilla, and stood up to go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We met, Mark, to remove all the obstacles that stand in the way of our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness, but instead of that we are increasing them. You handle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roughly things that are sacred to me. Why did you call me here? I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought you had surrendered, that we should take one another's hands for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ever. Every time I have taken the path down the cliff it has been in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this hope, and in the end I am disappointed. Do you know, Mark, where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>true life lies?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In the heart of a loving woman. To be the friend of such a woman...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tears stifled her voice, but through her sobs she whispered: "I cannot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark. Neither my intellect nor my strength are sufficient to dispute</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with you. My weapon is weak, and has no value except that I have drawn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it from the armoury of a quiet life, not from books or hearsay. I had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought to conquer you with other weapons. Do you remember how all this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>began?" she said, sitting down once more. "At first I was sorry for you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You were here alone, with no one to understand you, and everyone fled at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sight of you. I was drawn to you by sympathy, and saw something</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strange and undisciplined in you. You had no care for propriety, you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were incautious in speech, you played rashly with life, cared for no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>human being, had no faith of your own, and sought to win disciples. From</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>curiosity I followed your steps, allowed you to meet me, took books from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you. I recognised in you intellect and strength, but strangely mixed and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>directed away from life. Then, to my sorrow, I imagined that I could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>teach you to value life, I wanted you to live so that you should be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>higher and better than anyone else, I quarrelled with you over your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>undisciplined way of living. You submitted to my influence, and I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>submitted to yours, to your intellect, your audacity, and even adopted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>part of your sophistry."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But you soon," put in Mark, "retraced your steps, and were seized with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fear of your Grandmother. Why did you not leave me when you first became</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aware of my sophistry? Sophistry!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It was too late, for I had already taken your fate too intimately to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart. I believed with all possible ardour that you would for my sake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>comprehend life, that you would cease to wander about to your own injury</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and without advantage to anyone else, that you would accept a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>substantial position of some kind...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vice-governor, Councillor or something of the kind," he mocked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What's in the name? Yes, I thought that you would show yourself a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of action in a wide sphere of influence."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As a well-disposed subject and as jack of all trades, and what else?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My lifelong friend. I let my hopes of you take hold on me, and was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carried away by them, and what are my gains in the terrible conflict?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>One only, that you flee from love, from happiness, from life, and from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your Vera." She drew closer to him and touched his shoulder. "Don't fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from us, Mark. Look in my eyes, listen to my voice, which speaks with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the voice of truth. Let us go to-morrow up the hill into the garden, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-morrow there will be no happier pair than we are. You love me, Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark, do you hear? Look at me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She stooped, and looked into his eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He got sharply to his feet, and shook his mass of hair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera took up her black mantilla once more, but her hands refused to obey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her, and the mantilla fell on the floor. She took a step towards the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>door, but sank down again on the bench. Where could she find strength to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hold him, when she had not even strength to leave the arbour, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wondered. And even if she could hold him, what would be the consequences?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Not one life, but two separate lives, two prisons, divided by a grating.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We are both brusque and strong, Vera; that is why we torture one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another, why we are separating."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I were strong, you would not leave Malinovka; you would ascend the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hill with me, not clandestinely, but boldly by my side. Come and share</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>life and happiness with me. It is impossible that you should not trust</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me, impossible that you are insincere, for that would be a crime. What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shall I do? How shall I bring home to you the truth?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You would have to be stronger than I, but we are of equal strength.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>That is why we dispute and are not of one mind. We must separate without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bringing our struggle to an issue, one must submit to the other. I could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>take forcible possession of you as I could of any other woman. But what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in another woman is prudery, or petty fear, or stupidity, is in you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength and womanly determination. The mist that divided us is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dispersed; we have made our position clear. Nature has endued you with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>powerful weapon, Vera. The antiquated ideas, morality, duty, principles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and faiths that do not exist for me are firmly established with you. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are not easily carried away, you put up a desperate fight and will only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>confess yourself conquered under terms of equality with your opponent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You are wrong, for it is a kind of theft. You ask to be conquered, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to carry off all the spoils! I, Vera, cannot give everything, but I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>respect you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera gave him a glance in which there was a trace of pride, but her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart beat with the pain of parting. His words were a model of what a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>farewell should be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We have gone to the bottom of the matter," said Mark dully, "and I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leave the decision in your hands." He went to the other side of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arbour, keeping his eyes fixed upon her. "I am not deceiving you even</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now, in this decisive moment, when my head is giddy--I cannot. I do not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>promise you an unending love, because I do not believe in such a thing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I will not be your betrothed. But I love you more than anything else in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the world. If, after all I have told you, you come to my arms, it means</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that you love me, that you are mine."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked across at him with wide open eyes, and felt that her whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>body was trembling. A doubt shot through her mind. Was he a Jesuit, or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was the man who brought her into this dangerous dilemma in reality of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unbending honour?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yours for ever?" she said in a low voice. If he said, "yes," it would,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she knew, be a bridge for the moment to help her over the abyss that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>divided them, but that afterwards she would be plunged into the abyss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She was afraid of him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark was painfully agitated, but he answered in a subdued tone, "I do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not know. I only know what I am doing now, and do not see even into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>near future. Neither can you. Let us give love for love, and I remain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>here, quieter than the waters of the pool, humbler than grass. I will do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what you will, and what do you ask more. Or," he added suddenly, coming</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nearer, "we will leave this place altogether...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In a lightning flash the wide world seemed to smile before her, as if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the gates of Paradise were open. She threw herself in Mark's arms and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>laid her hand on his shoulder. If she went away into the far distance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with him, she thought, he could not tear himself from her, and once</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alone with her he must realise that life was only life in her presence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will you decide!" he asked seriously. She said nothing, but bowed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head. "Or do you fear your Grandmother?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The last words brought her to her senses, and she stepped back.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I do not decide," she whispered, "it is only because I fear her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The old lady would not let you go."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She would let me go, and would give me her blessing, but she herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would die of grief. That is what I fear. To go away together," she said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dreamily, "and what then?" She looked up at him searchingly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And then? How can I know, Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will suddenly be driven from me; you will go and leave me, as if I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were merely a log?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why a log? We could separate as friends."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Separation! Do the ideas of love and separation exist side by side in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your mind? They are extremes which should never meet. Separation must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only come with death. Farewell, Mark! You can never promise me the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness that I seek. All is at an end. Farewell!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Farewell, Vera!" he said in a voice quite unlike his own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Both were pale, and avoided one another's eyes. In the white moonlight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that gleamed through the trees Vera sought her mantilla, and grasped the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gun instead. At last she found the mantilla, but could not put it on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shoulders. Mark helped her mechanically, but left his own belongings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind. They went silently up the path, with slow and hesitating steps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as if each expected something from the other, both of them occupied with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the same mental effort to find a pretext for delay. They came at last to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the spot where Mark's way lay across a low fence, and hers by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>winding path through the bushes up to the park.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera stood still. She seemed to see the events of her whole life pass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before her in quick succession, but saw none filled with bitterness like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the present. Her eyes filled with tears. She felt a violent impulse to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>look round once more, to see him once more, to measure with her eyes the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>extent of her loss, and then to hurry on again. But however great her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sorrow for her wrecked happiness she dare not look round, for she knew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it would be equivalent to saying Yes to destiny. She took a few steps up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the path.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark strode fiercely away towards the hedge, like a wild beast baulked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of his prey. He had not lied when he said that he esteemed Vera, but it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was an esteem wrung from him against his will, the esteem of the soldier</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for a brave enemy. He cursed the old-fashioned ideas which had enchained</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her free and vivacious spirit. His suffering was the suffering of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>despair; he was in the mood of a madman who would shatter a treasure of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which the possession was denied him, in order that no one else might</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>possess it. He was ready to spring, and could hardly restrain himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from laying violent hands on Vera. By his own confession to her he would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have treated any other woman so, but not Vera. Then the conviction</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gnawed at his heart that for the sake of the woman who was now escaping</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him he was neglecting his "mission." His pride suffered unspeakably by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the confession of his own powerlessness. He admitted that the beautiful</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>statue filled with the breath of life had character; she acted in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accordance with her own proud will, not by the influence of outside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suggestion. His new conception of truth did not subdue her strong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>healthy temperament; it rather induced her to submit it to a minute</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>analysis and to stick closer to her own conception of the truth. And now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she was going, and as the traces of her footsteps would vanish, so all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that had passed between them would be lost. And with her went all the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>charm and glory of life, never to return.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He stamped his feet with rage and swung himself on to the fence. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would cast one glance in her direction to see if the haughty creature</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was really going.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"One more glance," thought Vera. She turned, and shuddered to see Mark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sitting on the fence and gazing at her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Farewell, Mark," she cried, in a voice trembling with despair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>From his throat there issued a low, wild cry of triumph. In a moment he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was by her side, with victory and the conviction of her surrender in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have come back, for always? You have at last understood. What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happiness! God forgive...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She did not complete her sentence, for she lay wrapt in his embrace, her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sobs quenched by his kisses. He raised her in his arms, and like a wild</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>animal carrying off his prey, ran with her back to the arbour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>God forgive her for having turned back.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky lay on the grass at the top of the cliff for a long time in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gloomy meditation, groaning over the penalty he must pay for his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>generosity, suffering alike for himself and Vera. "Perhaps she is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>laughing at my folly, down there with him. Who is there?" he cried aloud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stung with rage. "I will have his name." He saw himself merely as a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shield to cover her passion. He sprang up wildly, and hurried down the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice, tearing his clothes in the bushes and listening in vain for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suspicious rustling. He told himself that it was an evil thing to pry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into another's secret; it was robbery. He stood still a moment to wipe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sweat from his brow, but his sufferings overcame his scruples. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>felt his way stealthily forward, cursing every broken branch that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cracked under his feet, and unconscious of the blows he received on his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face from the rebounding branches as he forced his way through. He threw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself on the ground to regain his breath, then in order not to betray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his presence crept along, digging his nails into the ground as he went.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he reached the suicide's grave he halted, uncertain which way to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>follow, and at length made for the arbour, listening and searching the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ground as he went.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Meanwhile everything was going on as usual in Tatiana Markovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>household. After supper the company sat yawning in the hall, Tiet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nikonich alone being indefatigable in his attentions, shuffling his foot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when he made a polite remark, and looking at each lady as if he were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ready to sacrifice everything for her sake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is Monsieur Boris?" inquired Paulina Karpovna, addressing Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Probably he is paying a visit in the town. He never says where he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spends his time, so that I never know where to send the carriage for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Inquiries made of Yakob revealed the fact that he had been in the garden</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up to a late hour. Vera was not in the house when she was summoned to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tea. She had left word that they were not to keep supper for her, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that she would send across for some if she were hungry. No one but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had seen her go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna sighed over their perversity, to be wandering about at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>such hours, in such cold weather.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will go into the garden," said Paulina Karpovna. "Perhaps Monsieur</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris is not far away. He will be delighted to see me. I noticed," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>continued confidentially, "that he had something to say to me. He could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not have known I was here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka whispered to Vikentev that he did know, and had gone out on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that account.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will go, Marfa Vassilievna, and hide behind a bush, imitate Boris</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pavlovich's voice and make her a declaration," suggested Vikentev.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Stay here, Nikolai Andreevich. Paulina Karpovna might be frightened and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>faint. Then you would have to reckon with Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am going into the garden for a moment to fetch the fugitive," said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God be with you, Paulina Karpovna," said Tatiana Markovna. "Don't put</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your nose outside in the darkness, or at any rate take Egorka with you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to carry a lantern."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, I will go alone. It is not necessary for anyone to disturb us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You ought not," intervened Tiet Nikonich politely, "to go out after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eight o'clock on these damp nights. I would not have ventured to detain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you, but a physician from DЭsseldorf on the Rhine, whose book I am now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reading and can lend you if you like, and who gives excellent advice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>says...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna interrupted him by asking him if he would see her home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and then went into the garden before he could resume his remarks. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>agreed to her request and shut the door after her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Soon after Paulina Karpovna's exit there was a rustling and crackling on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the precipice, and Raisky wearing the aspect of a restless, wounded</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>animal, appeared out of the darkness. He sat for several minutes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>motionless on Vera's favourite bench, covering his eyes with his hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Was it dream or reality, he asked himself. He must have been mistaken.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Such a thing could not be. He stood up, then sat down again to listen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>With his hands lying listlessly on his knees, he broke into laughter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over his doubts, his questionings, his secret. Again he had an access of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terrible laughter. Vera--and _he_. The cloak which he himself had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sent to the "exile" lay near the arbour. The rogue had been clever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>enough to get two hundred and twenty roubles for the settlement of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wager, and the earlier eighty in addition. Sekleteia Burdalakov!</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Again he laughed with a laugh very near a groan. Suddenly he stopped,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and put his hand to his side, seized with a sudden consciousness of pain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera was free, but he told himself she had dared to mock another fellow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>human being who had been rash enough to love her; she had mocked her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friend. His soul cried for revenge.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He sprang up intent on revenge, but was checked by the question of how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to avenge himself. To bring Tatiana Markovna, with lanterns, and a crowd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of servants and to expose the scandal in a glare of light; to say to her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Here is the serpent you have carried for two and twenty years in your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bosom"--that would be a vulgar revenge of which he knew himself to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>incapable. Such a revenge would hit, not Vera, but his aunt, who was to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him like his mother. His head drooped for a moment; then he rose and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hurried like a madman down the precipice once more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>There in the depths passion was holding her festival, night drew her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>curtain over the song of love, love ... with Mark. If she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surrendered to another lover, to the tall, handsome Tushin, the owner of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>land, lake, and forest, and the Olympian tamer of horses....</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He could hardly breathe. Against his will there rose before him, from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the depths of the precipice, the vision of Vera's figure, glorified with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a seductive beauty that he had never yet seen in her, and though he was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>devoured by agony he could not take his eyes from the vision. At her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feet, like a lion at rest, lay Mark, with triumph on his face. Her foot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rested on his head. Horror seized him, and drove him onward, to destroy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and mar the vision. He seemed to hear in the air the flattering words,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the songs and the sighs of passion; the vision became fainter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mist-enshrouded, and finally vanished into air, but the rage for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>revenge remained.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Everywhere was stillness and darkness, as he climbed the hill once more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but when he reached Vera's bench he saw a human shadow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who is there?" he cried.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Monsieur Boris, it is I, Paulina."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You, what are you doing here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I came, because I knew, I knew that you have long had something to say</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to me, but have hesitated. Du courage. There is no one to see or hear us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>_EspИrez tout...._"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you want? Speak out."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>_"Que vous m'aimez._ I have known it for a long time. _Vous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>m'avez fui, mais la passion vous a ramenИ ici...._"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He seized her roughly by the hand, and pushed her to the edge of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, _de grАce. Mais pas si brusquement ... qu'est-ce que vous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>faites ... mais laissez donc,_" she groaned.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her anxiety was not altogether groundless, for she stood on the edge of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an abrupt fall of the ground, and he grasped her hand more determinedly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You want love," he cried to the terrified woman. "Listen, to-night is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>love's night. Do you hear the sighs, the kisses, the breath of passion?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let me go! Let me go! I shall fall."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Away from here," he cried, loosening his grasp and drawing a deep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Like a madman he ran across the garden and the flower garden into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yard, where Egorka was washing his hands and face at the spring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Bring my trunk," he cried. "I am going to St. Petersburg in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning." He ran water over his hands and washed his face and eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before he turned to go to his room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He could not stay within the four walls of his chamber. He went out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>again and again, unprotected against the cold, to look at Vera's window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was hardly possible to see ten paces ahead in the darkness. He went</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to the acacia arbour to watch for Vera's return, and was furious because</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he could not conceal himself there, now that the leaves had fallen. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sat there in torture until morning dawned, not from passion, which had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been drowned in that night's experiences. What passion would stand such</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a shock as this? But he had an unconquerable desire to look Vera in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face, this new Vera, and with one glance of scorn to show her the shame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the affront she had put on him, on their aunt, on the whole household,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on their society, on womanhood itself. He awaited her return in a fever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of impatience. Suddenly he sprang up with an evil look of triumph on his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Fate has given me the idea," he thought. He found the gates still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>locked, but there was a lamp before the ikon in Savili's room, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ordered him to let him out and to leave the gates unlocked. He took from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his room the bouquet holder and hastened to the orangery to the gardener.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had to wait a long time before it opened. The light grew stronger.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he looked over at the trees in the orangery, an evil smile again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crossed his face. The gardener was arranging Marfinka's bouquet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I want another bouquet," said Raisky unsteadily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"One like this?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, only orange blossoms," he whispered, turning paler as he spoke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Right, Sir," said the gardener, recalling that one of Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna's young ladies was betrothed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am thirsty," said Raisky. "Give me a glass of water."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He drank the water greedily, and hurried the gardener on. When the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>second bouquet was ready he paid lavishly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He returned to the house cautiously, carrying the two bouquets. As he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not know whether Vera had returned in his absence, he had Marina</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>called, and sent her to see if her mistress was at home or had already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gone out walking. On hearing she was out he ordered Marfinka's bouquet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to be put on Vera's table and the window to be opened. Then he dismissed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina, and returned to the acacia arbour. Passion and jealousy set</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loose raged unchecked, and when pity raised her head she was quenched by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the torturing, overmastering feeling of outrage. He suppressed the low</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>voice of sympathy, and his better self was silent. He was shuddering,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conscious that poison flowed in his veins, the poison of lies and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deception.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I must either shoot this dog Mark, or myself," he thought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He held the bouquet of orange-blossoms in his two hands, like a sacred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thing, and drank in its beauty with a wild delight. Then he fixed his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes on the dark avenue, but she did not come.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Broad daylight came, a fine rain began to fall and made the paths sodden.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At last Vera appeared in the distance. His heart beat faster, and his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knees trembled so that he had to steady himself by the bench to keep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from falling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She came slowly nearer, with her bowed head wrapped in a dark mantilla,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>held in place over her breast by her pale hands, and walked into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>porch without seeing him. Raisky sprang from his place of observation,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and hid himself under her window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She entered her room in a dream, without noticing that her clothes which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had flung on the floor when she went out had been put back again,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and without observing the bouquet on the table or the opened window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mechanically she threw aside her mantilla, and changed her muddy shoes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for satin slippers; then she sank down on the divan, and closed her eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>After a brief minute she was awakened from her dream by the thud of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>something falling on the floor. She opened her eyes and saw on the floor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a great sheaf of orange blossoms, which had plainly been thrown through</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the window.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pale as death, and without picking up the flowers, she hurried to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>window. She saw Raisky, as he went away, and stood transfixed. He looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>round, and their eyes met.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She was seized by pain so sharp that she could hardly breathe, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stepped back. Then she saw the bouquet intended for Marfinka on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table. She picked it up, half unconsciously, to press it to her face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but it slipped from her hands, and she herself fell unconscious on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>floor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXV</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At ten o'clock the big bell in the village church began to sound for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mass. Tatiana Markovna's household was full of stir and bustle. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>horses were being harnessed to the calХche and to an old fashioned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carriage. The coachmen, already drunk, donned their new dark blue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>caftans, and their hair shone with grease. The women servants made a gay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>picture in their many coloured cotton dresses, head and neck kerchiefs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the maids employed in the house diffused a scent of cloves within a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ten yards radius. The cooks had donned their white caps in the early</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning, and had been incessantly busy in the preparation of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breakfast, dinner and supper to be served to the family and their guests,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the kitchen, and the servants the visitors brought with them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna had begun to make her toilet at eight o'clock, as soon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as she had given her orders; she descended to the hall to greet her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guests with the reserved dignity of a great lady, and the gentle smile</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of a happy mother and a hospitable hostess. She had set a small simple</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cap on her grey hair; the light brown silk dress that Raisky had brought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from St. Petersburg suited her well, and round her neck she wore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beautiful old lace; the Turkish shawl lay on the arm-chair in her room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now she was preparing to drive to Mass, and walked slowly up and down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the hall with crossed hands, awaiting the assembly of the household. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly noticed the bustle around her, as the servants went hither and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thither, sweeping the carpets, cleaning the lamps, dusting the mirrors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and taking the covers from the furniture. She went first to one window</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and then to the other, looking out meditatively on the road, the garden</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the courtyards.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vikentev's mother was dressed in pearl grey with dark lace trimmings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vikentev himself had been in his dress coat and white gloves from eight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>o'clock onwards.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna's pride and joy knew no bounds when Marfinka appeared,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>radiating gaiety from her bright eyes. While she slept the walls of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>two rooms had been decorated with flowers and garlands. She was going to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>put on her simple blouse when she woke, but instead there lay on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chair by her bed a morning gown of lace and muslin with pink ribbons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She had not had time to give vent to her admiration when she saw on two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other chairs two lovely dresses, one pink and one blue, for her to make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her choice for the gala day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She jumped up, and threw on her new morning gown without waiting to put</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on her stockings, and when she approached her mirror she found a new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>surprise in the gifts that lay on her toilet table. She did not know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which to look at, or which to take up.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>First she opened a lovely rosewood casket which contained a complete</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dressing set, flasks, combs, brushes and endless trifles in glass and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silver, with a card bearing the name of her future Mama. Beside it lay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cases of different sizes. She threw a quick glance in the mirror,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>smoothed back her abundant hair from her eyes, seized all the cases in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heap, and sat down on the bed to look at them. She hesitated to open</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them, and finally began with the smallest, which contained an emerald</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ring, which she hastily put on her finger. A larger case held earrings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which she inserted in her ears and admired in the glass from the bed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There were massive gold bracelets, set with rubies and diamonds, which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she also put on. Last of all she opened the largest case, and looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>astonished and dazzled at its splendid contents: a chain of strung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>diamonds, twenty-one to match her years. The accompanying card said:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"With this gift I confide to you another, a costly one, my best of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friends--myself. Take care of him. Your lover, Vikentev."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She laughed, looked round, kissed the card, blushed, sprang from the bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and laid the case in her cupboard, in the box where she kept her bonbons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There was still another case on the table, containing Raisky's gift of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>watch, whose enamel cover bore her monogram, and its chain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked at it with wide eyes, threw another glance at the other gifts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the garlanded walls, then threw herself on a chair and wept hot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tears of joy. "Oh, God!" she sobbed happily. "Why does everyone love me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so. I do no good to anyone, and never shall."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>And so, undressed, without shoes and stockings, but adorned with rings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bracelets, diamond earrings, she tearfully sought her aunt, who caressed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and kissed her darling when she heard the cause of her tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God loves you, Marfinka, because you love others, because all who see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you are infected by your happiness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka dried her tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nikolai Andreevich loves me, but he is my fiancИ; so does his Mama, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so does my cousin, Boris Pavlovich, and what am I to him?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The same as you are to everyone. No one can look at you and not be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happy; you are modest, pure and good, obedient to your Grandmother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Spendthrift," she murmured in an aside, to hide her pleasure. "Such a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>costly gift! You shall hear of this, Borushka!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother! As if Boris Pavlovich could have guessed it. I have wanted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a little enamelled watch like this for a long time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You haven't asked your Grandmother why she gives you nothing?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka shut her mouth with a kiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother," she said, "love me always, if you want to make me happy."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"With my love I will give you my enduring gift," she said, making the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sign of the cross over Marfinka. "So that you shall not forget my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blessing," she went on, feeling in her pocket--"You have given me two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dresses, Grandmother, but who decorated my room so magnificently?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your fiancИ and Paulina Karpovna sent the things yesterday, and kept</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them out of your sight. Vassilissa and Pashutka hung the garlands up at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>daybreak. The dresses are part of your trousseau, and there are more to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>follow." Then taking from its case a gold cross with four large diamonds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she hung it round the girl's neck, and gave her a plain, simple bracelet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the inscription: "From Grandmother to her Grandchild," and with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>name and the date.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka kissed her aunt's hand, and nearly wept once more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"All that Grandmother has, and she has many things, will be divided</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>between you and Veroshka. Now make haste."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How lovely you are to-day, Grandmother. Cousin is right. Tiet Nikonich</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will fall in love with you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nonsense, chatterbox. Go to Veroshka, and tell her not to be late for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mass. I would have gone myself, but am afraid of the steps."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Directly, Grandmother," cried Marfinka, and hastened to change her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dress.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera lay unconscious for half an hour before she came to herself. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cold wind that streamed through the open window fell on her face, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she sat up to look around her. Then she rose, shut the window, walked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unsteadily to the bed, sank down on it, and drawing the cover over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself, lay motionless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Overpowered with weakness she fell into a deep sleep, with her hair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loose over the pillow. She slept heavily for about three hours until she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was awakened by the noise in the courtyard, the many voices, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>creaking of wheels and the sound of bells. She opened her eyes, looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>round, and listened.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>There was a light knock at the door, but Vera did not stir. There was a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>louder knock, but she remained motionless. At the third she got up,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glanced in the glass, and was terrified by the sight of her own face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She pushed her hair into order, threw a shawl over her shoulders, picked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up Marfinka's bouquet from the floor, and laid it on the table. There</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was another knock and she opened the door. Marfinka, gay and lovely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gleaming like a rainbow in her pretty clothes, flew into the room. When</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she saw her sister she stood still in amazement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the matter with you, Veroshka? Aren't you well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not quite. I offer you my congratulations."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The sisters kissed one another.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How lovely you are, and how beautifully dressed!" said Vera, making a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>faint attempt to smile. Her lips framed one, but her eyes were like the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes of a corpse that no one has remembered to close. But she felt she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must control herself, and hastened to present Marfinka with the bouquet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a lovely bouquet! And what is this?" asked Marfinka as she felt a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hard substance, and discovered the holder set with her name and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pearls. "You, too, Veroshka! How is it you all love me so? I love you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all, how I love you! But how and when you found out that I did, I cannot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>think."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera was not capable of answering, but she caressed Marfinka's shoulder</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affectionately.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I must sit down," she said. "I have slept badly through the night."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother calls you to Mass."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot, darling. Tell her I am unwell, and cannot leave the house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-day."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What! you are not coming?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I shall stay in bed. Perhaps I caught cold yesterday. Tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We will come to you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You would only disturb me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Then we shall send everything over. Ah, Veroshka, people have sent me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so many presents, and flowers and bonbons. I must show them to you," and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she ran over a list of them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, show me everything; perhaps I will come later," said Vera absently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Another bouquet?" asked Marfinka, pointing to the one that lay on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>floor. "For whom? How lovely!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For you too," said Vera, turning paler. She picked a ribbon hastily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from a drawer and fastened the bouquet with it. Then she kissed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sister, and sank down on the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are really ill. How pale you are! Shall I tell Grandmother, and let</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her send for the doctor? How sad that it should be on my birthday. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>day is spoiled for me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It will pass. Don't say a word to Grandmother. Don't frighten her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leave me now, for I must rest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At last Marfinka went. Vera shut the door after her, and lay down on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXVI</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Raisky returned to his room at daybreak and looked in the mirror,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he hardly recognised himself. He felt chilly, and sent Marina for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glass of wine which he drank before he threw himself on his bed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Overcome by moral and physical exhaustion he slept as if he had thrown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself into the arms of a friend and had confided his trouble to him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sleep did him the service of a friend, for it carried him far from Vera,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from Malinovka, from the precipice, from the fantastic vision of last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>night. When the ringing of many bells awoke him he lay for several</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>minutes under the soothing influence of the physical rest, which built a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rampart between him and yesterday. There was no agony in his awakening</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>moments. But soon memory revived, and his face wore an expression more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terrible than in the worst moments of yesterday. A pain different from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yesterday's, a new devil had hurled itself upon him. He seized one piece</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of clothing after another and dressed as hastily and nervously as Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had done as she prepared to go to the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He rang for Egorka, from whom he learnt that everybody except Vera, who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was not well, had driven to Mass. In wild agitation he dashed across to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the old house. There was no response when he knocked at Vera's door. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opened it cautiously, and stole in like a man with murderous intent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with horror imprinted on his features, and advanced on tiptoe, trembling,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deadly pale, with swaying steps as if he might fall at any minute.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera lay on the divan, with her face turned away, her hair falling down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>almost to the floor, and her slipper-clad feet hardly covered by her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grey skirt. She tried to turn round when she heard the noise of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opening door, but could not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He approached, knelt at her feet, and pressed his lips to the slipper</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she wore. Suddenly she turned, and stared at him in astonishment. "Is it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>comedy or romance, Boris Pavlovich," she asked brusquely, turned in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>annoyance, and hid her foot under the skirt which she straightened</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quickly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Vera, tragedy," he whispered in a lifeless voice, and sat down on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the chair near the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The tone of his voice moved her to turn and look keenly at him, and her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes opened wide with astonishment. She threw aside her shawl, and rose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had divined in Raisky's face the presence of the same deadly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffering that she herself endured.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is your trouble? Are _you_ unhappy?" she said, laying her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hand on his shoulder. In the simple word and in the tone of her voice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there were revealed the generous qualities of a woman, sympathy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>selflessness, and love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Keenly touched by the kindness and tenderness in her voice he looked at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her with the same rapturous gratitude which she had worn on her face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yesterday when in self-forgetfulness he had helped her down the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice. She returned generosity with generosity, just as yesterday</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there had streamed from him a gleam of one of the highest qualities of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the human mind. He was all the more in despair over what he had done,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and wept hot tears. He hid his face in his hands like a man for whom all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is lost.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What have I done? I have insulted you, woman and sister."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not make us both suffer," she said in a gentle, friendly tone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Spare me; you see how I am."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He tried not to meet her eyes, and she again lay down on the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What a blow I dealt you," he whispered in horror. "You see my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>punishment, Vera!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your blow gave me a minute's pain, and then I understood that it was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not delivered with an indifferent hand, that you loved me. And it became</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>clear to me how you must have suffered ... yesterday."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't justify my crime, Vera. A knife is a knife, and I aimed a knife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You brought me to myself. I was as if I slept, and you, Grandmother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka and the whole house I saw as if in a dream."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What am I to do, Vera? Fly from here? In what a state of mind I should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leave! Let me endure my penance here, and be reconciled, as far as is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>possible, with myself, with all that has happened here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your imagination paints what was only a fault as a crime. Remember your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>condition when you did it, your agitation!" She gave him her hand, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>continued, "I know now what one is capable of doing in the fever of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>emotion."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She set herself to calm him in spite of her own weariness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are good, Vera, and, womanlike, judge not with your brain, but with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your heart."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are too severe with yourself. Another would have thought himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>justified after all the jesting.... You remember those letters. With</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whatever good intention of calming your agitation, of answering your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>jest with jests, it was malicious mockery. You suffered more from those</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>letters than I did yesterday."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh, dear, no! I have often laughed over them, especially when you asked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for a cloak, a rug, and money for the exile."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What money? what cloak? what exile?" she exclaimed in astonishment. "I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>don't understand."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I myself had suspicions," he said, his face clearing a little. "I could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not believe that that was your idea." And in a few words he told her the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contents of the two letters.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her lips turned white.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Natasha and I wrote to you turn and turn about in the same handwriting,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>amusing little letters in which we tried to imitate yours; that is all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I didn't know anything about the other letters," she whispered, turning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her face to the wall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky strode up and down in thought, while Vera appeared to be resting,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exhausted by the conversation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Cousin," she said suddenly, "I ask your help in a very important matter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and I know you will not refuse me." A glance at his face told her that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there was nothing she could not ask of him. "While I still have strength,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I want to tell you the whole history of this year."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why should you do that? I will not and I ought not to know."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not disturb me, Boris. I can hardly breathe and time is precious. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will tell you the whole story, and you must repeat it to our Grandmother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I could not do it," she said. "My tongue would not say the words--I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would rather die."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked at her with an expression of blank terror. "But why should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother be told? Think of the consequences. Would it not be better</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to keep her in ignorance?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, the burden must be borne. It is possible that Grandmother and I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will both die of it, or we shall lose our senses, but I will not deceive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her. She ought to have known it long ago, but I hoped to be able to tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her another story, and therefore was silent."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To tell her everything, even of yesterday evening," he asked in a low</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tone. "And the name also?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She nodded almost imperceptibly in assent. Then she made him sit down on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the divan beside her, and in low, broken sentences told the story of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>relations with Mark. When she had finished she wrapped herself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shivering with cold, in her shawl. He rose from his seat. Both were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silent, each of them in terror, she as she thought of her grandmother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he as he thought of them both. Before him lay the prospect of having to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deal Tatiana Markovna one thrust after another, and that not in the heat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of passion, or in an access of blind revenge, but in the consciousness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of a most painful duty. It might be as she said an important service,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but it was certainly a terrible commission.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When shall I tell her?" he asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As soon as possible, for I shall suffer so long as I know she is in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ignorance, and now, give me the eau-de-Cologne from the dressing-table,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and leave me alone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It would not do to tell Grandmother to-day when the house is full of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guests, but to-morrow...." said Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How shall I survive it? But till to-morrow, calm her by some means or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>other, so that she has no suspicion and sends no one here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She closed her eyes in a longing for impenetrable night, for rest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without an awakening; she would like to have been turned into a thing of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stone so that she could neither think nor feel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he left her he was weighed down with a greater weight of fear than</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that which he had brought to the interview. Vera rose as soon as he left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her, closed the door, and lay down again. She had found consolation and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>help in Raisky's friendship, his sympathy and devotion, as a drowning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>man rises to the surface for a moment, but as soon as he was gone she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fell back deeper into the depths. She told herself in despair that life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was over. Before her there stretched the bare steppe; there was no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>longer for her a family, nor anything on which a woman's life depends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She would have to stand before her aunt, to look her in the eyes, and to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell her how she had recompensed her love and care. Suddenly she heard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>steps and her aunt's voice. Pale and motionless, as if she had lost the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>use of hands and feet, she listened to the light tap at the door. I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not get up, I cannot, she thought. But when the knock was repeated, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sprang up with a strength which astonished herself, dried her eyes and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went smiling to meet her aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Tatiana Markovna had heard from Marfinka that Vera was ill, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would remain in her room all day, she had come herself to inquire; she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glanced at Vera and sat down on the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The service has tired me so that I could hardly walk up the steps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>What's the matter with you, Vera?" she continued, looking keenly at her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I congratulate Marfinka on her birthday," said Vera, in the voice of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>little girl who has learnt her speech by heart. She kissed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grandmother's hand and wondered how she had managed to bring the words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over her lips. "I got wet feet yesterday, and have a headache." She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tried to smile, but there was no smile on her lips.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must rub your feet with spirit," remarked Tatiana Markovna, who had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>noticed the strained voice and the unnatural smile, and guessed a lack</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of frankness. "Are you coming to be with us, Vera? Don't force yourself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to do so, and so make yourself worse," she continued, seeing that Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was incapable of answering.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera was all the more frightened by her aunt's consideration for her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her conscience stirred, and she felt that Tatiana Markovna must already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>know all, and that her confession would come too late. She was on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>point of falling on her breast, and making her confession there and then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but her strength failed her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Excuse me, Grandmother, from dinner; perhaps I will come over in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afternoon."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As you like. I will send your dinner across."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank you, I am already quite hungry," said Vera quickly, without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knowing what she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna kissed her, and stroked her hair, remarking casually</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that one of the maids should come and do her room, as she might have a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>visitor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna returned sadly to the house. She was, indeed, politely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>attentive to her guests as she always was, but Raisky noticed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>immediately that something was wrong with her after her visit to Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She found it hard to restrain her emotion, hardly touched the food, did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not even look round when Petrushka smashed a pile of plates, and more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>than once broke off in the middle of a sentence. In the afternoon as the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guests took coffee on the broad terrace in the mild September sunshine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna moved among her guests as if she were hardly aware of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them. Raisky wore a gloomy air and had eyes for no one but his aunt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Something is wrong with Vera," she whispered to him. "She is in trouble.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Have you seen her?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No," he said. But his aunt looked at him as if she doubted what he said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna had not come. She had sent word that she was ill, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the messenger brought flowers and plants for Marfinka. In order to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>explain the scene of the day before, and to find out whether she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>guessed anything, Raisky had paid a visit in the morning to Paulina</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Karpovna. She received him with a pretence of being offended, but with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly disguised satisfaction. His excuse was that he had dined with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friends that night and had had a glass too much. He begged for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forgiveness which was accorded with a smile, all which did not prevent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Karpovna from recounting to all her acquaintance her love scene.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin came to dinner, and brought Marfinka a lovely pony to ride. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked for Vera, and was plainly disturbed when he heard of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indisposition which prevented her from coming to dinner. Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna observed him, wondering why Vera's absence had such a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remarkable effect on him, though this had often been the case before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without exciting any surprise on her part. She could not keep out of her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head anxiety as to what change had come over Vera since yesterday</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>evening. She had had a little quarrel with Tiet Nikonich, and had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>scolded him for having brought Marfinka the SХvres mirror. Afterwards</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she was closeted with him for a quarter of an hour in her sitting-room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and he emerged from the interview looking serious. He shifted his foot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>less, and even when he was talking to ladies his serous inquiring glance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would wander to Raisky or Tushin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Up till this time Tatiana Markovna had been so gay. Her one anxiety, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at the moment the only one perhaps, had been the celebration of Vera's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nameday a fortnight ahead, she would have liked to have celebrated it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the same magnificence as Marfinka's birthday, although Vera had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roundly declared that on that day she meant to go on a visit to Anna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivanovna Tushin, or to her friend Natasha. But how Tatiana Markovna had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>changed since Mass. As she talked with her guests she was thinking only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Vera, and gave absent-minded answers. The excuse of a cold had not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deceived her, and as she had touched Vera's brow on leaving her, she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>realised that a cold could be nothing but a pretext. She remembered that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera and Raisky had vanished in the afternoon and that neither had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appeared at supper. She was constantly watching Raisky, who sought to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>avoid her glance, thereby only arousing her suspicions the more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then Vera herself unexpectedly appeared amongst the guests, wearing a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>warm mantilla over her light dress and a wrap round her throat. Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was so astonished that he looked at her as if she were an apparition. A</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>few hours ago she had been almost too exhausted to speak, and now here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she was in person. He wondered where women found their strength. Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went round speaking to the guests, looked at Marfinka's presents, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ate, to quench her thirst, as she said, a slice of water melon. Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna was to some extent relieved to see Vera, but it disturbed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to notice that Raisky's face had changed. For the first time in her life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she cursed her guests; they were just sitting down to cards, then there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would be tea, and then supper, and Vikentev was not going until</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to-morrow morning.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXVII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky found himself between two fires. On the one hand, Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna looked at him as much as to say that he probably knew what was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the matter with Vera, while Vera's despairing glance betrayed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anxiety for the moment of her confession. He himself would have liked to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have sunk into the earth. Tushin looked in an extraordinary manner at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera, as both Tatiana Markovna and Raisky, but most of all Vera herself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>noticed. She was terrified, and asked herself whether he had heard any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rumour. He esteemed her so highly, thought her the noblest woman in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>world, and, if she were silent, she would be accepting his esteem on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>false premisses. He, too, would have to be told, she thought. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exchanged greetings with him without meeting his eyes; and he looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strangely at her, timidly and sympathetically. Vera told herself that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she must know what was in his mind, that if he looked at her again like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that she would collapse. He did look at her again, and she could endure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no more and left the company. Before she went she signed secretly to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin to follow her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot receive you in the old house," she said, "Come into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>avenue."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it not too damp, as you are not well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That does not matter," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked at his watch and said that he would be going in an hour. After</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>giving orders to have his horses taken out of the stable and brought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the yard, he picked up his silver-handled whip and with his cloak</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on his arm followed Vera into the avenue. "I will not beat about the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bush," he said. "What is the matter with you to-day? You have something</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on your mind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She wrapped her face in her mantilla as she spoke, and her shoulders</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shivered as if with cold. She dare not raise her eyes to him as he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strode silently beside her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But you are ill, Vera Vassilievna. I had better talk to you another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time. You were not wrong in thinking I had something to say to you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Ivan Ivanovich, let it be to-day. I want to know what you have to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>say to me. I myself wanted to talk to you, but perhaps it is too late</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for what I have to say. Do you speak," she said, wondering painfully how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and where he could have learnt her secret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I came here to-day...." he said as they sat down on the bench.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What have you to say to me? Speak!" she interrupted.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How can I say it to you now, Vera Vassilievna?" said Tushin springing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to his feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not make me suffer," she murmured.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I love you...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, I know it," she interrupted. "But what have you heard?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have heard nothing," he said, looking round in amazement. He was now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for the first time aware of her agitation, and his heart stood still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with delight. She has guessed my secret and shares my feelings, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought, and what she is asking, is for a frank, brief avowal. "You are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so noble, so beautiful, Vera Vassilievna, so pure...." An exclamation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was wrung from her, and she would have risen, but could not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You mock me, you mock me," she said, raising her hands beseechingly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are ill, Vera Vassilievna," he said, looking at her in terror.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgive me for having spoken to you at such a time."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A day earlier or later makes no difference. Say what you have to say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for I also desire to tell you why I have brought you here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is it really true?" he cried, hardly knowing how to contain his delight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is true? You want to say something else, not what I expected," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said. "Speak, and do not prolong my sufferings."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I love you," he repeated. "If you can grant what I have confessed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you (and I am not worthy of it), if your love is not given elsewhere,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then be my forest queen, my wife, and there will be no happier man on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>earth than I. That is what I have long wished to say to you and have not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dared. I should have done it on your nameday but I could no longer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>endure the suspense, and have come to-day, on the family festival, on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your sister's birthday."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ivan Ivanovich," she moaned. The thought flashed through his head like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lightning that this was no expression of joy, and he felt his hair was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beginning to stand on end. He sat down beside her and said, "What is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wrong with you, Vera Vassilievna? You are either ill, or are bearing a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>great sorrow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Ivan Ivanovich! I feel that I shall die."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is your trouble? For God's sake, tell me. You said that you had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>something to confide in me, which means that I must be necessary to you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there is nothing I would not do for you. You have only to command me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Forgive me my too hasty speech."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You, too, my poor Ivan Ivanovich! I can find neither prayers nor tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nor is there any guidance or help for me anywhere."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What words of despair are these, Vera Vassilievna?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you know _whom_ you love?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He threw his cloak on the bench, and wiped the sweat from his brow. Her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>words told him that his hopes were ruined, that her love was given</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>elsewhere. He drew a deep breath, and sat motionless, awaiting her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>further explanations.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My poor friend," she said, taking his hand. The simple words filled him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with new sorrow; he knew that he was in fact to be pitied.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank you," he whispered. "Forgive me ... I did not know, Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna ... I am a fool.... Please forget my declaration. But I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should like to help you, since you say yourself you rely on me for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>service. I thank you for holding me worthy of that. You stand so high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>above me; I always feel that you stand so high, Vera Vassilievna."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My poor Ivan Ivanovich, I have fallen from those heights, and no human</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>power can reinstate me," she said, as she led him to the edge of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you know this place?" she asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, a suicide is buried there."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There, in the depths below the precipice, your 'pure' Vera also lies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>buried," she said with the decision of despair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What are you saying? I don't understand. Enlighten me, Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Summoning all her strength she bent her head and whispered a few words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to him, then returned, and sank down on the bench. Tushin turned pale,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>swayed, lost his balance, and sat down beside her. Even in the dim light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera noticed his pallor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And I thought," he said, with a strange smile, as if he were ashamed of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his weakness, rising to his feet with difficulty, "that only a bear was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strong enough to knock me over." Then he stooped to her and whispered,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The question sent a shudder through her, but she answered quickly:</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mark Volokov."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His face twitched ominously. Then he pressed his whip over his knee so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that it split in pieces, which he hurled away from him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So it will end with him too," he shouted. As he stood trembling before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her, stooping forward, with wild eyes, he was like an animal ready to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spring on the enemy. "Is he there now?" he cried, pointing with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>violent gesture in the direction of the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She looked at him as if he were a dangerous animal, as he stood there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breathing heavily; then she rose and took refuge behind the bench.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am afraid, Ivan Ivanovich! Spare me! Go!" she exclaimed, warding him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>off with her arms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"First I will kill him, and then I will go."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you going to do this for my sake, for my peace of mind or for your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>own sake?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He kept silence, his eyes fixed on the ground, and then began to walk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>about in great strides. "What should I do?" he said, still trembling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with agitation. "Tell me, Vera Vassilievna."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"First of all, calm yourself, and explain to me why you wish to kill him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and whether I desire it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He is your enemy, consequently also mine."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does one kill one's enemies?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He bent his head and seeing the pieces of the whip lying on the ground</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he picked them up as if he were ashamed, and put them in his pocket.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do not accuse him. I alone bear the blame, and he has justification,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she said with such bitter misery that Tushin took her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera Vassilievna," he said, "you are suffering horribly. I do not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understand," he went on, looking at her with sympathy and admiration,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"what you mean by saying that he has justification, and that you bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no accusation against him. If that's the case, why did you wish to speak</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to me and call me here into the avenue?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because I wanted you to know the whole truth."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Don't leave me in the dark, Vera Vassilievna. You must have had some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reason for confiding your secret to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You looked at me so strangely to-day that I could not understand your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>meaning, and thought you must already be informed of all that had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happened and could not rest until I knew what was in your mind. I was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>too hasty, but it comes to the same thing, for sooner or later I should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have told you. Sit down, and hear what I have to say, and then have done</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with me." She explained the situation to him in a few words.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So you forgive him," he asked, after a moment's thought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgive him, of course. I tell you that I alone am guilty."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you separated from him, or do you hope for his return?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is nothing whatever in common between us, and we shall never see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one another again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now, I understand a little, for the first time, but still not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everything," said Tushin, sighing bitterly. "I thought you had been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vulgarly betrayed, and, since you called me to your help, I imagined</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that the time had come for the Bear to do his duty. I was on the point</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of rendering you the service of a Bear, and it was for that reason that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I permitted myself to ask boldly for the man's name. Forgive me, and now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell me why you have revealed the story to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because I was not willing that you should think better of me than I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deserve, and esteem me...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But how would you accomplish that? I shall not cease to think of you as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I have always thought of you, and I cannot do otherwise than respect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A gleam of pleasure lighted her eyes, only to be immediately</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>extinguished. "You want to restore my self-esteem," she said, "because</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you are good and generous. You are sorry for a poor unfortunate girl and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>want to raise her up again. I understand your generosity, Ivan Ivanovich,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but I will have none of it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera Vassilievna," he said, kissing her hand. "I could not esteem</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anybody under compulsion. If I give anyone a greeting in the street, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>has my esteem; if he has not my esteem, I pass him by. I greet you as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before, and because you are unhappy my love for you is greater than</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before. You are enduring a great sorrow, as I am. You have lost your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hopes of happiness," he added in a low, melancholy tone. "If you had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kept your secret from me and I had heard it by chance, even so my esteem</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for you could not have been diminished. For there is no duty laid on you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to reveal a secret which belongs to you alone. No one has the right to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>judge you." The last words were spoken in a trembling voice which made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it clear that he also was oppressed by the secret, the weight of which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he desired to lighten for Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I had to tell you to-day when you made your declaration to me. I felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it was impossible to leave you in ignorance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You might very well have answered me with a categorical 'No.' But since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you do me the honour, Vera Vassilievna, of bestowing your particular</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friendship on me, you might have gilded your 'No' by saying that you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>loved another. That would have been sufficient for me, for I should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>never have asked you who, and your secret would, without doubt, have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remained your own." He pointed to the precipice, and collecting his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole strength whispered, "A misfortune...." Although he tried with all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his might not to let her see how disturbed he was, he was hardly able to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>speak clearly. "A misfortune," he repeated. "You say that he has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>justification, that the guilt is yours; if that is so, where does</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>justice lie?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I told you, Ivan Ivanovich, that my confession was not necessary for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your sake, but for mine. You know how I esteem your friendship, and it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would have caused me unspeakable pain to deceive you. Even now, when I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have hidden nothing from you, I cannot look you in the eyes." Tears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stifled her voice, and it was with difficulty that Tushin held back his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>own tears; he stooped and kissed her hand once more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thanks, a thousand thanks, Vera Vassilievna. I see that an affection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for another has no power to lessen your friendship for me, and that is a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wonderful consolation."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ivan Ivanovich, if I could only cut this year out of my life."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A speedy forgetfulness," he said, "comes to the same thing."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How can I forget, and where can I find the strength to endure its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>memory?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You will find strength in friendship, and I am one of your friends."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She breathed another air for the moment, conscious that there was beside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her a tower of strength, under whose shadow her passion and her pain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were alleviated. "I believe in your friendship, Ivan Ivanovich, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thank you for it," she said, drying her tears. "I already feel calmer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and should feel still calmer if Grandmother...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She does not yet know anything of this?" he asked, but broke off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>immediately in the consciousness that his question involved a reproach.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She has guests to-day and could not possibly be told, but to-morrow she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shall learn all. Farewell, Ivan Ivanovich, my head aches, and I am going</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back to the house to lie down." Tushin looked at Vera, asking himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>how any man could be such a blind fool as Volokov. Or is he merely a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beast, he thought to himself in impotent rage. He pulled himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>together, however, and asked her if she had any instructions for him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Please ask Natasha," she said, "to come over to me to-morrow or the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>next day."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And may I come one day next week to inquire whether you are better?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not be anxious, Ivan Ivanovich. And now good-bye, for I can hardly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stand."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he left her, he drove his horses so wildly down the steep hill that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he himself was in danger of being hurled to the bottom of the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he put his hand out as usual for his whip, it was not there, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remembered that he had broken it, and threw away the useless pieces on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the road. In spite of his mad haste he reached the Volga too late for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the ferry. He had to stay in the town with a friend, and drove next</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning to his home in the forest.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXVIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In Tatiana Markovna's house, servants, cooks and coachmen were all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>astir, and at a very early hour in the morning were already drunk. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mistress of the house herself was unusually silent and sad when she let</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka go with her future mother-in-law. She had no instructions or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>advice to give, and hardly listened to Marfinka's questions about what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she ought to take with her. "What you like," she said absently, and gave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>orders to Vassilissa and the maid who was going with Marfinka to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Kolchino to put everything in order and pack up what was necessary. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>handed over her dear child to Marfa Egorovna's charge, at the same time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pointing out to Marfinka's fiancИ that he must take the greatest care of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her, and that in order not to give strangers a wrong impression, he must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be more dignified and must not chase about the garden and the woods with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her as he did in Malinovka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When she saw that Vikentev coloured at this advice, which indicated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>doubt of his tactfulness, and that Marfa Egorovna bit her underlip,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna changed her tone; she laid her hand on his shoulder</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>calling him "Dear Nikolinka," and telling him that she knew herself how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unnecessary her words were, but that old women liked to preach. Then she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sighed, and said not another word to her guests before their departure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera too came to breakfast; she looked pale, and it was clear that she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had had a sleepless night. She said she still had a headache, but felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>better than she did yesterday. There was no change in Tatiana Markovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affectionate manner to her. Now and then Marfa Egorovna cast questioning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glances in Vera's direction. What was the meaning of pain without any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>definite illness? Why did she not appear yesterday until after dinner,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and then only for a moment, to go out followed by Tushin. What had they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>found to say to one another for an hour in the twilight? Being a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sensible woman she did not pursue these inquiries, though they flashed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for a moment in her eyes; nevertheless Vera saw them, although they were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quickly exchanged for looks of sympathy. Neither did Marfa Egorovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>questioning glances escape Tatiana Markovna, who kept her eyes on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ground, while Vera maintained her indifferent manner. Already people are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wondering what had happened, thought Tatiana Markovna sadly; on my arms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she came into the world, she is my child and yet I do not know what her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trouble is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had been out for a walk before breakfast, and wore on his face a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>look as if he had just come to a decision on a momentous question. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked at Vera as calmly as at the others, and did not avoid Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna's eyes. He promised Vikentev to come over to see him in a day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or two, and listened attentively to his guest's conversation about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hunting and fishing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>At last everything was ready for their departure. Tatiana Markovna and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went with their guests as far as the Volga, leaving Vera at home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's world had always been a small one, and its boundaries were now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drawn more narrowly than ever. She had been contented during the long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>years with the observation and experience which were accessible to her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in her immediate environment. Her small circle represented to her the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crowd; she made her own in a short time what it took others many years</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in many places to learn. Unlike Marfinka she was cautious in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sympathies, granting her friendship only to the priest's wife and to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin, whom she openly called her friend. The simple things and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>simple people who surrounded her did not serve only trivial purposes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She understood how to embroider on this ordinary canvas the bold pattern</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of a richer life with other needs, thoughts and feelings; she guessed at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these by reading between the lines of everyday life other lines which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expressed the desires of her mind and heart. If she was cautious in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sympathies she was excessively so in the sphere of thought and knowledge.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She read books from the library in the old house, taking from the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shelves at first without choice or system as a pastime whatever came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into her hands; then she began to experience curiosity, and finally a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>definite desire for knowledge. She was keen-sighted enough to understand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>how aimless and unfruitful it was to wander among these other minds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without any guiding thread. Without making direct inquiries she procured</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some explanations from Koslov, and although she understood many things</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>at a bound, she never let it be seen that she had any knowledge of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things beyond her immediate circle. Without losing sight of Koslov's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>instructions she read the books once more, to find that they meant much</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>more to her and that her interest in them was steadily increasing. At</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the request of the young priest, Natasha's husband, she brought him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>books too, and listened when he expressed his views on this or that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>author, without herself adopting the seminarist view.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Later on she came into contact with Mark, who brought a new light to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bear on all that she had read and heard and known; his attitude was one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of blank denial. No authority in heaven or earth weighed with him, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>despised science as it had hitherto developed, and made no distinction</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>between virtue and crime. If he thought that he would soon be able to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>triumph over Vera's convictions he was mistaken. She regarded these bold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and often alluring ideas with shy admiration, without giving herself up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blindly to their influence; she listened cautiously to the preaching of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the apostle, but found in it neither a new life, nor happiness, nor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>truth, and, though she followed attentively what he had to say, it was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only because she was drawn on by the ardent desire to find the reality</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that lay behind Mark's extraordinary and audacious personality. Mark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>displayed his unsparing negation, enmity and scorn against all that men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>believe, love and hope for; Vera did not agree with all she heard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>because she observed the malady that lay concealed behind the teaching,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>even if she could not discover where it lay. Her Columbus could show her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing but a row of open graves standing ready to receive all that by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which society had hitherto existed. Vera remembered the story of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pharaoh's lean kine, which without themselves becoming fatter devoured</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the fat kine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark would have despoiled mankind of his crown in the name of wisdom; he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would acknowledge in him nothing but an animal organism. And while he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>denied man in man, denied him the possession of a soul and the right to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>immortality, he yet spoke of his strivings to introduce a better order</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of things, neglecting to observe that in accordance with his own theory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the chance arrangement of existence, by which men herd together like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flies in the hot weather; such efforts were useless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Granting the correctness of his ideas as a premiss, thought Vera, there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>can be no sense in striving to be better, kinder, truer and purer, if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>this life enduring only for a few decades is the end of all things. When</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she looked deeper into the matter and examined the new truth taught by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the young apostle, the new conception of good and the new revelation,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she saw with astonishment that what in his talk was good and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>incontrovertible was not new, that it was derived from sources from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which others also drew, who certainly did not belong to the new society;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she recognised that the seed of the new civilisation which he preached</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with so much boastfulness and such a parade of mystery lay in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old-fashioned doctrine, and for this reason she believed more firmly than</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ever in the older philosophy of life. She looked on Mark's personality</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with such suspicion that she gradually withdrew herself from his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>influence. Hideously disturbed by his audacity of thought, she had even</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gone so far as to tell Tatiana Markovna of this accidental acquaintance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the result that the old lady told the servants to keep a watch on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the garden, but Volokov came from the direction of the precipice, from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which the watchmen were effectually kept away by their superstitious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fears. Mark himself had noted Vera's distrust, and he set himself to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>overcome it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He was the more easily able to accomplish this because, when her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>interest was once awakened, she met him halfway, imperceptibly to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself. She meditated carefully on the facts that made up her life; her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mind was occupied by new questionings, and for that reason she listened</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>more attentively to his words when she met him in the fields. Often they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went out walking on the banks of the Volga, and eventually found a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>meeting-place in the arbour at the bottom of the precipice. Gradually</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera adopted a more active role in their intercourse. She wanted to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>convert him, to lead him back to the acceptance of proved truth, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>truth of love, of human as opposed to animal happiness, of faith and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hope. Mark gave way in some things, though only gradually; his manners</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>became less eccentric, he was less provocative in his behaviour to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>police than before, he lived in a more orderly fashion, and ceased to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stud his conversation with cynical remarks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The change pleased Vera, and this was the cause of the happy excitement</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that Tatiana Markovna and Raisky had remarked in her. Since her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>influence was effective even if only in what affected his external life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she hoped by incessant effort and sacrifice gradually to produce a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>miracle; her reward was to be the happiness of being loved by the man of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her heart's choice. She flattered herself that she would be introducing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a new strong man into society. If he were to show himself in wisdom and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength of will, simply and reliable, as Tushin was, her life was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mapped out for her. While she was engaged in these efforts she allowed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her passionate nature to be carried away by his personality; she fell in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>love, not with his doctrine, which she refused to accept, but with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself. He called to new activity, but she saw in his appeal nothing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>more than the lending of forbidden books. She agreed with him that work</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was necessary, and herself avoided idleness; she drew up for herself a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>picture of simple genuine activity for the future, and envied Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>because she understood how to make herself useful in the house and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>village. She intended to share these labours with her sister when once</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the stiff battle with Mark had been brought to a conclusion; but the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>struggle was not to end with a victory for either one or the other, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with mutual overthrow and a permanent separation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>These were the thoughts that passed through Vera's mind while Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna and Raisky were accompanying their guests and Marfinka as far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as the Volga. What was the Wolf doing now? was he enjoying his triumph?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She took from her letter case a sealed letter on blue paper which she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had received early that morning and looked at it thoughtfully for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>minute before she threw it down with its seals unbroken on the table.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>All her troubles were submerged in the painful question, what would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>become of her Grandmother. Raisky had already whispered to Vera that he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would speak to Tatiana Markovna that evening if she were alone, and that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he would take care that none of the servants should have the opportunity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of seeing the impression which the news was bound to make on her. Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shivered with foreboding when he spoke of these precautions; she would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have liked to have died before evening came. After her talk of past</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>events with Raisky and Tushin she recovered something of her usual</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>calmness; a part of her burden was gone now that, like a sailor in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>storm, she had lightened the ship of some of its ballast, but she felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that the heaviest load of all still lay on her conscience. It is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>impossible to go on living like this, she told herself, as she made her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>way to the chapel. There, on her knees, she looked anxiously up at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>holy picture as if she expected a sign, but the sign she longed for was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not granted, and she passed out of the chapel in despair as one who lay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>under the ban of God.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXIX</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Tatiana Markovna returned from the ferry she sat down to work at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her accounts, but soon laid them aside, and dismissed the servants. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked for Raisky, who had gone over to see Koslov because he did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>want to be left alone with his aunt. She sent across to ask Vera whether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she was coming to dinner. Vera said that she would rather stay in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>room and go to bed early.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the courtyard a scene by no means unusual was being enacted. Savili</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had nearly broken Marina's back with a severe beating because he had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seen her slipping out at dawn from the room in which Vikentev's servant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was quartered. She hid herself in the fields and the vegetable garden,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but at last she emerged, thinking that he would have forgotten. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>struck her with the whip while she sought refuge in one corner after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another, swearing by all that was sacred that the devil had taken on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>figure and had made a fool of him. But when he exchanged the whip for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the stick she cried out aloud at the first blow and fell at his feet. "I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>am guilty," she cried, begging for mercy. She promised not to transgress</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>again, calling God to witness of her sincerity. Thereupon Savili threw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away the stick and wiped his face with his sleeve.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You may go this time," he said, "since you have confessed, and since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you call God to witness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna was informed of this proceeding, but she only wrinkled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her forehead, and made a sign to Vassilissa not to be too severe with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marina.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>There were visitors to dinner who had heard of Vera's indisposition and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had come to inquire. Tatiana Markovna spoke of a chill, suffering all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the time from her insincerity, since she did not know what was the truth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that lay behind this feigned illness. She had not dared to send for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>doctor, who would have immediately seen that it was a moral, not a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>physical malady.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She ate no supper; Tiet Nikonich politely said that he had no appetite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>either. Then came Raisky, who also wanted no supper, but sat silently at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table pretending not to notice the glances which Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>directed towards him from time to time.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Tiet Nikonich had made his bow and departed, Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>prepared to retire. She hardly looked at Raisky when she bade him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>good-night, because her affections and her self-esteem were both too</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>deeply wounded. A secret and serious misfortune had befallen the family,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but she was left on one side like a stranger, as if she were a useless,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>incapable woman. Raisky said in a low voice that he must speak with her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Bad news?" she whispered, shivering and looking fixedly at him before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she passed with him into her own room. She dropped into her old chair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and pushed the lamp farther away, first covering it with a shade, so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that the room was dimly lighted. Raisky began his tale as cautiously as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>possible, but his lips trembled and now and again his tongue refused its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>office, but he collected all his strength and went on, although towards</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the end of his story his voice was hardly audible.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Dawn had come, but throughout the long hours Tatiana Markovna had sat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>motionless and speechless with bowed head, giving vent now and then to a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>low moan. Raisky fell on his knees before her and implored her, "Go to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's help."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She has sent too late for Grandmother. God will go to her help. Spare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her and console her as you know how to do. She no longer has a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother," she said, going towards the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother, what is the matter with you?" cried Raisky barring her way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have no longer a Grandmother," she said absently. "Go, go." As he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not obey, she cried angrily, "Don't come here. I will see no one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You must all of you leave me in peace." He would have replied, but she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made an impatient gesture with her hand. "Go to her," she continued.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Help her as far as you can. Grandmother can do nothing: you have no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>longer a Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She made another gesture with her hand, so imperious this time that he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went without further parley, but he concealed himself in the yard and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>watched her window. Tatiana Markovna sank back in her chair and closed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her eyes, and for a long time she remained there, cold and stiff as if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she were a dead woman. Raisky, who had not gone to bed, and Vassilissa</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Yakob as well, saw Tatiana Markovna with her head uncovered and her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Turkish shawl thrown round her shoulders leave the house in the early</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning and go out into the garden. It was as if a bronze figure had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>descended from its pedestal and had begun to walk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She passed through the flower garden and then through the avenue to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice; then, striding slowly along, with her head held high and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without looking round, she went down the face of the cliff, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>disappeared. Concealing his presence in the trees, Raisky hurried after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her, following her as she passed deeper and deeper down the precipice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and until she reached the arbour, where she paused. Raisky came closer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and held his breath as he listened to Tatiana Markovna's heavy sighs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and then heard her whisper, "My sin." With her hands above her head she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>walked hastily on, until she came to the bank of the river and stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>still. The wind wound her dress round her ankles, disordered her hair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and tugged at her shawl, but she noticed nothing. A terrible idea dawned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on Raisky that she intended to drown herself. But his aunt turned back</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as she had come, with slow strides which left deep prints in the damp</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sand. Raisky breathed more freely; but when, following her track in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>parallel direction, he caught sight of her face, he held his breath in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>horror at the agony he saw written there. She had spoken truly, their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grandmother existed no longer. This was not grandmother, not Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna, the warm-hearted mistress of Malinovka, where the life and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>prosperity of the whole place depended on her, the wise and happy ruler</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of her little kingdom. It was as if she were not walking of her own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accord but was driven on by an impulse exterior to herself, as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unconscious of her movements she climbed the steep hill through the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brushwood, with her shawl hanging down from her shoulders dragging its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>corners in the dust; her eyes, from which stony horror looked forth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were unwinking; her manner was that of a moonstruck woman. Raisky found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it difficult to follow her. She paused once, leaning both hands on a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tree. "My sin," she exclaimed again. "How heavy is the burden! If it is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not lightened, I can bear it no longer." She began again to climb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quickly up the hill, surmounting the difficulties of the steep path</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with unnatural strength and leaving tags of her dress and her shawl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind her in the bushes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Overcome with amazement and horror, Raisky watched this new strange</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman. He knew that only great souls conquer heavy trouble with strength</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>like hers. They have wings like eagles to soar into the clouds and eagle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>eyes to gaze into the abyss. This was not his grandmother; she seemed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him to be one of those feminine figures which emerge from the family</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>circle in the supreme moments of life under the heavy blows of fate, who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bear great misfortunes majestically and are not overwhelmed. He saw in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her a Jewess of the olden days, a noble woman of Jerusalem, who scorns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the prophecy that her people will lose their fame and their honour to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Romans, but when the hour of fate has arrived, when the men of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Jerusalem are watering its walls with their tears and beating their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heads against the stones, then she takes the ornaments from her hair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>puts on mourning garments, and goes on her pilgrimage wherever the hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Jehovah leads. His mind went back to another queen of misfortune, to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Russian Marfa, the enemy of the city of Moscow, who maintained her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>defiance even in her chains, and, dying, directed the destiny of free</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Novgorod. Before his imagination there passed a procession of other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffering women, Russian Tsaritsas, who, at the wish of their husbands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had adopted the dress of the nun and had maintained their intellect and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their strength of character in the cloister....</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky diverted his attention from these unsummoned apparitions, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked attentively at the suffering woman before him. Tatiana Markovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kingdom was perishing. Her house was left desolate; her dearest treasure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her pride, her pearl, had been taken from her, and she wandered lonely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>among the ruins. When she paused in her walk in order to collect her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength, she tottered and would have fallen but for an inner whisper</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which assured her she would yet reach her goal. She pulled herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>together, and wandered on until evening. Half asleep, terrified by her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>crowding fancies, she spent the night on the sofa. At dawn she rose, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went once more to the precipice. With her head resting on the bare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>boards she sat for a long time on the crumbling threshold of the arbour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then she went through the fields, and was lost in the thicket on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bank of the river. By chance her steps led her to the chapel, where new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terror seized her at the sight of the picture of the Christ. She fell on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her knees like a wounded animal, covered her face with her shawl, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>moaned, "My sin! my sin!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna's servants had lost their heads in terror. Vassilissa</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Yakob hardly stirred from the church. She intended, if her mistress</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>recovered, to make her pilgrimage on foot to Kiev in order to venerate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the miracle worker; he promised to the patron saint of the village a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thick wax candle ornamented with gold. The rest of the servants hid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>themselves, and only looked shyly out after their mistress as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wandered distraught through the fields and the woods.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For two days already Tatiana Markovna had eaten nothing. Raisky indeed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tried to restrain her from leaving the house again, but she waved him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>imperiously away. Then with decision he took a jug of water, came up to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her, and took her hand. She looked at him as if she did not know who he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was, then mechanically seized the jug in her trembling hand, and drank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>greedily in big mouthfuls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother, come home again, and do not make both yourself and us</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wretched," he begged. "You will kill yourself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is God's will; I shall not lose my reason, for I am upheld by His</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength. I must endure to the end. Do you raise me if I fall. My sin!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she murmured and went on her way. After she had gone a few steps, she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>turned round and he ran to her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If I do not survive," she began, signing to him to bow his head. Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knelt down, and she pressed his head to her breast, laid her hands on it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and kissed him. "Accept my blessing, deliver it to Marfinka, and to her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to my poor Vera. Do you understand, to her also."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother!" he cried, kissing her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She tore her hand away, and set out to wander once more through the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thicket, by the river bank, and in the fields. A devout soul obeys its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>own laws, thought Raisky, as he dried his tears; only a saint could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffer like this for the object of her love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Things were not going any better with Vera. Raisky made haste to tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her of his conversation with their aunt; when she sent for him early</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>next morning, in her anxiety to have news of Tatiana Markovna, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pointed out of the window, and Vera saw how Tatiana Markovna was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drifting, urged on by the heavy hand of misfortune. For a moment she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>caught sight of her expression, and sank horrified on the floor, but she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pulled herself up again, ran from one window to the other, and stretched</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her hands out towards her grandmother. Then she rushed through the wide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>empty hall of the old house in a wild desire to follow Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but she realised in time that it would have killed her aunt if she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>approached her just now. Vera was conscious now how deeply she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wounded another life so close to her own, as she saw the tragic figure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of her aunt, so happy until recently and now bearing the punishment of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another's sin. Raisky brought her Tatiana Markovna's blessing, and Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fell on his neck and wept for a long time.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On the evening of the second day, Vera was found sitting in a corner of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the great hall, half dressed. Raisky and the priest's wife, who had just</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arrived, led her almost by force into her room and laid her down on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bed. Raisky sent for the doctor, to whom he tried to explain her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indisposition. The doctor prescribed a sedative, which Vera drank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without being any calmer for it; she often waked in her sleep to ask</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>after her grandmother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Give me something to drink ... don't say a word. Do not let anyone come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to see me. Find out what Grandmother is doing." It was just the same in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the night. When she awoke, she would whisper, "Grandmother doesn't come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother doesn't love me any more. She has not forgiven me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On the third day Tatiana Markovna left the house without being observed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>After two sleepless nights, Raisky had lain down and had given</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>instructions to wake him if she left the house, but Yakob and Vassilissa</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had gone to early Mass, and the other servants had paid no attention.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Later on Savili saw that his mistress, catching hold of the trees as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>went, was making her way from the precipice to the fields. Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hurried after her and watched her slow return to the house; she stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>still, looked round as if she were saying goodbye to the group of houses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>groped with her hands, and swayed violently. Then he rushed up to her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brought her back to the house with Vassilissa's help, put her in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>armchair and sent for the doctor. Vassilissa fell on her knees before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her mistress.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Little mother! Tatiana Markovna," she begged, "come back to us. Make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sign of the Cross."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna crossed herself, sighed, and signed that she could not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>speak and wanted something to drink. Vassilissa undressed her, wrapped</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her in warm sheets, rubbed her hands and feet with spirit, and then gave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her some warm wine to drink. The doctor prescribed for her, but said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that it was most important of all that she should not be disturbed, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should be allowed to sleep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>An incautious word that Tatiana Markovna was ill reached Vera's ears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She pushed past Natalie Ivanovna, and wanted to go over to the new house;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had great difficulty in persuading her to abandon her intention</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as Tatiana Markovna lay in a deep sleep. In the evening Vera was worse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had fever and was delirious, and during the night she flung herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from one side to another, calling on her grandmother in her sleep, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>weeping. Raisky wanted to call the old doctor; he waited impatiently</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>till the morning and spent his time in going from Vera to Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna, and from Tatiana Markovna back to Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As Vera's condition had not improved next morning, Raisky went with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa into Tatiana Markovna's bedroom, where they found the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lady in the same state as she had been in the whole of the day before.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am afraid of going near her in case I alarm her," he whispered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Should I awaken the mistress?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She must be awakened. Vera Vassilievna is ill, and I don't know whether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I ought to send for the old doctor."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when Tatiana Markovna sat up. "Is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera ill?" she said in a low voice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky breathed more freely, for his aunt, in her present anxiety, had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lost the stony expression of yesterday. She signed to him to leave the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>room. Half an hour later she was walking across the courtyard to the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house with trouble plainly depicted on her face, but apparently without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a trace of weariness. She entered Vera's room cautiously, and when she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saw the pale sleeping face, whispered to Raisky, "Send for the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>doctor." She now noticed for the first time the priest's wife and her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>weary eyes; she embraced Natalie Ivanovna, and advised her kindly to go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and get a whole day's rest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When the doctor arrived, Tatiana Markovna gave him an ingenious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>explanation of Vera's indisposition. He discovered symptoms of a nervous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fever and prescribed medicine; but on the whole he did not think that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>serious consequences need be expected if the patient could be kept quiet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera was half asleep when she took the medicine and towards evening fell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fast asleep. Tatiana Markovna sat down at the head of the bed, watching</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her movements and listening to her breathing. Presently Vera woke up and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked, "Are you asleep, Natasha?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As she received no answer she closed her eyes, but she could not go to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sleep again, and the darkness seemed to her to be a dark and terrible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>prison. After a time she asked for something to drink. Someone handed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her a cup.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How is Grandmother?" asked Vera, opening her eyes only to close them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>again immediately. "Natasha, where are you? Come here. Why are you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hiding?" she sighed and fell asleep again. Presently she woke again and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whispered pitifully, "Grandmother doesn't come. Grandmother loves me no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>longer, and has not forgiven me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother is here. She loves you and has forgiven you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera sprang from the bed and rushed up to Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother," she cried, half fainting and hiding her head on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna put her to bed again, leaned her grey head by Vera's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>white suffering face, while the girl in a low voice, with sighs and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tears, made her confession on her breast. Her aunt listened without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>speaking, and presently wiped away Vera's tears with her handkerchief,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and kissed her warmly and affectionately.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not waste your caresses on me, Grandmother; only do not leave me. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do not deserve your caresses. Keep your kisses for my sister."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your sister is no longer in need of my caresses. But I need your love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>If you forsake me, Vera, I shall be a desolate old woman." Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna wept.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mother, forgive me," whispered Vera, embracing her with her whole</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength. "I have not been obedient to you, and God has punished me,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she went on, but Tatiana Markovna shut her mouth with a kiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not talk like that, Vera," interrupted her grandmother, who had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>turned pale with horror and once more wore the aspect of the old woman</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who had been wandering about in the thicket by the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, I thought that my own brain and will were self-sufficing, that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was wiser than you all."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are wiser than I and have more learning," said Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breathing more freely. "God has given you a clear understanding, but you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have not my experience."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera thought that she had more experience also, but she merely said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Take me away from here. There is no Vera any longer. I want to be your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka. Take me away from this old house over there to you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The two heads rested side by side on the pillow. They lay in a close</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>embrace and fell asleep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXX</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera rose the next morning pale and exhausted, but without any fever.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She had wept out her malady on her grandmother's breast. The doctor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>professed himself satisfied, and said she should stay in her room for a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>few days. Everything in the house went on as before. There were no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>festivities in honour of Vera's name day, as she had expressed a wish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that there should be none. Neither Marfinka nor the Vikentevs came; a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>messenger was sent to Kolchino with the announcement that Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna was unwell and was keeping her room. Tushin sent his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>congratulations in a respectful note, asking for permission to come and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>see her. Her reply was that he should wait a little until she was better.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Under the pretext of Vera's illness, callers who came from the town to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>present their congratulations were not admitted. Only the servants</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>celebrated the occasion in their own way; the maids appeared in their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gay dresses, and the coachmen and the lackeys got drunk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera and her aunt developed a new relationship. Tatiana Markovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consideration for Vera was by no means assumed, but her kindness did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>make Vera's heart lighter. What she had expected and wished was severe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>judgment, a penance, perhaps exile for half a year or a year to Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna's distant estate, where she would gradually win back her peace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of mind or at any rate forget, if it was true, as Raisky said, that time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>extinguishes all impressions. "I see," thought Vera, "that Grandmother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffers inexpressibly. Grief has changed her altogether; her figure is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bowed and her face more deeply furrowed. Perhaps she is only sparing me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>now because her heart has opened itself to pity. She cannot bear to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>punish me, now that I am ill and repentant." Vera had lost her pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her self-respect and her dignity, and if once these flowers are taken</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out of the crown which adorns the head of man, his doom is at hand. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tried to pray and could not, for she had nothing to pray for, and could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>only bow her head in humility.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky came into much closer relation with his aunt and Vera. His</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>naturalness and genuine affection, the friendly intimacy of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conversation, his straightforwardness, his talkative humour, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gleaming play of his fancy were a distraction and a consolation to both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of them. He often drew a laugh from them, but he tried in vain to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>distract them from the grief which hung like a cloud over them both and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over the whole house. He himself was sad when he saw that neither his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>esteem nor Tatiana Markovna's kindness could give back to poor Vera her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>courage, her pride, her confidence and her strength of will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna spent the nights in the old house on the divan opposite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's bed and watched her sleep. But it nearly always happened that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they were both observing one another, so that neither of them found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>refreshing sleep. On the morning after a sleepless night of this kind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna sent for Tiet Nikonich. He came gladly, plainly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>delighted that the illness which threatened Vera Vassilievna had blown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over, and bringing with him a water melon of extraordinary size and a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pineapple for a present. But a glance at his old friend was enough to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>make him change colour. Tatiana Markovna hastily put on her fur-trimmed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cloak, threw a scarf over her head, and signed to him to follow her as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she led the way into the garden. They sat for two hours on Vera's bench.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then she went back to the house with bowed head, while he drove home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>overcome with grief, ordered his servants to pack, sent for post horses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and drove to his estate, to which he had not been for many years.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky, who had gone to see him, heard the news with astonishment. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>questioned his aunt, who told him that some disturbance had broken out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on Tiet Nikonich's estate. Vera was sadder than ever. Lines began to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appear on her forehead, which would one day become furrows. Sometimes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she would approach the table on which the unopened blue letter lay and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then turn away. Where should she flee, where conceal herself from the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>world? When night fell, she lay down, put out the light, and stared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wide-eyed in front of her. She wanted to forget, to sleep, but sleep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would not come. Dark spots, blacker than night, danced before her eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shadows moved up and down with a wave-like motion in the glimmer of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>light that lay around the window. But she felt no fear, she would not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have died of terror if there had risen suddenly out of the corner a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ghost, a thief or a murderer; she would not have felt any fear if she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had been told that her last hour was come. She looked out unceasingly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into the darkness, at the waving shadows, at the flitting specks which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stood out the more clearly in the blackness of the night, at the rings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of changing colour which whirled shimmering round her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Slowly and quietly the door opened. Vera propped herself on her elbow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and saw a hand carrying a lamp carefully shaded. Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dropped her cloak from her shoulder on to a chair and approached the bed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking not unlike a ghost in her white dressing-gown. Vera had laid her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head back on the pillow and pretended to sleep. Tatiana Markovna put the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lamp on the table behind the bed-head, and sat down carefully and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quietly on the divan with her head leaning on her hand. She did not take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her eyes from Vera, and when Vera opened her own an hour later Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna was still looking fixedly at her. "Can't you sleep, Vera?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do you punish me in the night too, Grandmother?" asked Vera in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>low tone. The two women looked at one another and both seemed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understand the speech in their eyes. "You are killing me with sympathy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother," Vera went on. "It would be better to drive me from your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sight. But it is very hard for me to bear when you measure out your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>scorn drop by drop. Either forgive me or, if that is impossible, bury me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alive. Why are you silent? What is in your mind? Your silence tortures</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me; it seems to say something, and yet never says it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is so hard, Vera, to speak. Pray, and understand your Grandmother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>even when she is silent."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have tried to pray, and cannot. What have I to pray for, except that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I should die the sooner. I shall die I know; only let it come quickly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for like this it is impossible to live."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is possible," said Tatiana Markovna, drawing a deep sigh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"After ... that?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"After _that_," replied her grandmother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You don't know, Grandmother," said Vera with a hopeless sigh. "You have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not been a woman like me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna stooped down to Vera, and whispered in a hardy audible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>voice, "A woman like you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera looked at her in amazement, then let her head fall back on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pillow and said wearily, "You were never in my position. You are a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saint."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A sinner," rejoined Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We are all sinners, but not a sinner of that kind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Of that kind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera seized Tatiana Markovna's dress with both hands, and pressed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face to hers. The words that came from her troubled breast sounded like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hisses. "Why do you slander yourself? Is it in order to calm and help me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother, do not lie!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I never lie and you know it, and how should I begin to do so now. I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a sinner, and myself need forgiveness," she said, throwing herself on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her knees and bowing her grey head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why do you say these things to me?" said Vera, staring at the kneeling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woman, and pressing her head to her breast. "Take your words back again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I have not heard them or will forget them; will regard them as the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>product of a dream. Do not torture yourself for my sake. Rise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother." Tatiana Markovna lay on her breast, sobbing like a child.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why did you tell me this?" said Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It was God's wish that I should humble myself to ask you, my child, for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forgiveness. If you grant me your forgiveness, Vera, I, too, can forgive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you. I had hoped to keep my secret until I died, and now my sin has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>plunged you into ruin."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You rescue me, Grandmother, from despair."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And myself, Vera. God forgives, but he demands cleansing. I thought my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sin was forgotten and forgiven. Because of my silence I seemed to men to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be virtuous, but my virtue was a lie. God has punished my sin. Forgive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me from your heart."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Does one forgive one's Mother? You are a saint, a Mother without a peer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the whole wide world. If I had known you, as you really are, how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>could I have acted contrary to your will?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is my second terrible sin. I was silent, and did not tell you to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beware of the precipice. Your dead Mother will call me to account for my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>failure, I know. She comes to me in my dreams, and is now here between</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>us. Do you also forgive me, Departed One," she cried wildly, stretching</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out her arms in supplication.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera shuddered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgive me, Vera. I ask forgiveness of you both. We will pray."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera tried to raise her to her feet, and Tatiana Markovna raised herself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with difficulty, and sat down on the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera bathed her temples with eau de Cologne, and gave her a sedative;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then she kneeled down before her and covered her hand with kisses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is hidden must be revealed," began Tatiana Markovna, when she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>recovered a little. "For forty-five years only two human beings beside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>myself have known it, _he_ and Vassilissa, and I thought the secret</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would die with me. And now it is made public. My God!" she cried, wildly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stretching her folded arms to the picture of the Christ. "Had I known</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that this stroke would ever fall on another, on _my_ child, I would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have confessed my sin there and then to the all world in the Cathedral</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>square."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera still hesitated to believe what she heard. Was it a heroic measure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a generous invention to rescue and restore her own self-respect? But her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aunt's prayers, her tears, her appeal to Vera's dead mother, no actress</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would have dared to use such devices, and her aunt was the soul of truth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and honour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Warm life pulsed in Vera's heart, and her heart was lightened. She felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as if life was streaming through her veins after an evil dream. Peace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tapped at the door of her soul, the dark forsaken temple, which was now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gaily lighted once more and a home of prayer. She felt that Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna and she were inseparable sisters, and she even began</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>involuntarily to address her as "thou," as she had done Raisky when her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>heart responded to his kindness. As these thoughts whirled in her head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had a sensation of lightness and freedom, like a prisoner whose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fetters have been removed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother," she said, rising, "you have forgiven me, and you love me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>more than you do any of the others, more than Marfinka, that I realise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But do you know and understand my love for you? I should not have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffered as I did, but for my love for you. How long we have been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strangers!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will tell you all, Vera, and you must hear my confession. Judge me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>severely, but pardon me, and God will pardon us both."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will not, I ought not, I may not," cried Vera. "To what end should I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hear it?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"So that I may suffer once more, as I suffered five-and-forty years ago.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You know my sin, and Boris shall know it. He may laugh at the grey hairs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of old Kunigunde."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As she strode up and down, shaking her head in her fanatical seriousness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with sorrow and triumphant dignity in her face, her resemblance to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>old family portrait in the gallery was very marked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Beside her Vera felt like a small and pitiful child as she gazed timidly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into her aunt's eyes; she measured her own young strength by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength of this old woman who had ripened and remained unbroken in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>long struggle of life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My whole life can never repay what you have done for me, Grandmother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Let this be the end of your penance, and tell me no more. If you are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>determined that Boris shall know, I will whisper a word about your past</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to him. Since I have seen your anguish, why should you suffer a longer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>martyrdom? I will not listen. It is not my place to sit in judgment on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you. Let me hold your grey hairs sacred."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna sighed, and embraced Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As you will. Your will is like God's forgiveness to me, and I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grateful to you for sparing my grey hairs."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now," said Vera, "let us go across to your house, where we can both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna almost carried her across to the new house, laid her on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her own bed, and lay down beside her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Vera had fallen peacefully asleep, her aunt rose cautiously, and,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the light of the lamp, watched the marble beauty of her forehead, her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>closed eyes, all sculptured pure and delicate as if by a master hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and at the expression of deep peace that lay on her face. She made the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sign of the cross over Vera as she slept, touched her forehead with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lips, and sank on her knees in prayer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have mercy on her!" she breathed. "If Thy anger is not yet appeased,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>turn it from her and strike my grey head."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Presently she lay down beside Vera, with her arm around her neck. Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>woke occasionally, opened her eyes, and closed them again. She pressed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>closer and closer to Tatiana Markovna as if no harm could befall her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>within the circle of those faithful arms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXXI</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As the days went by Malinovka assumed its wonted calm. The quiet life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which had been brought to a pause by the catastrophe, flowed evenly on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The peaceful atmosphere was not undisturbed by anxiety. Autumn had laid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her hand on men as well as on nature. The household was thoughtful,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silent, and cold; smiles, laughter, and joy had vanished like the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>falling leaves, and even though the worst crisis was passed, it had left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind it an atmosphere of gloom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna ruled her little kingdom once more. Vera was busily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>engaged in the house, and devoted much care and taste to the choice of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's trousseau. She had determined not to avoid any task, however</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>simple and trivial it might be, while she awaited the opportunity of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some serious work that life might offer her; she recognised that with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>most people avoidance of the trivial and the hope of something</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>extraordinary and unprecedented were dictated either by idleness and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>incompetence, or by morbid self-love and vanity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She was paler than before, her eyes were less sparkling, and she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lost some of her vivacity of gesture; but these changes were put down by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everyone to her narrow escape from nervous fever.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In fulfilment of Tatiana Markovna's insistently expressed wish, Vera had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>spoken to Raisky of their aunt's passion, of which Tiet Nikonich had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been the object, but she said nothing of the sin. Even this partial</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>confidence explained to Raisky the riddle, how Tatiana Markovna, who in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his eyes was an old maid, could find the strength, not only to bear the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brunt of Vera's misfortune, but to soothe her, and to rescue her from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>moral collapse and despair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He showed in his intercourse with her, more clearly than before, a deep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and affectionate esteem, and an unbounded devotion. He now no longer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>contradicted her, so that an end was put to the earlier semi-comic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>warfare he had waged against her; even in his gestures there was a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>certain reserve. She inspired him with the astonishment and admiration</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which are called forth by women of exceptional moral strength.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The servants, too, were different, even though the cloud had passed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There was no sound of quarrelling, abuse or laughter. Vassilissa found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself in an exceptionally difficult position, since, now that her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mistress was restored to health, she was called on to fulfil her vow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>One morning Yakob vanished from the yard. He had taken money from the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>box where the cash was kept for buying the oil for the lamps kept</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>burning in front of the ikons, which were in his charge, and had bought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the promised candle, which he set up before the sacred picture in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>village church at early Mass. As there was a small surplus he crossed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself piously, then betook himself to the poorer quarter of the town,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where he spent his riches, and then reeled home again on his unsteady</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>legs, displaying a slight redness on his nose and his cheeks. Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna happened to meet him. She immediately smelt the brandy, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked in surprise what he had been doing. He replied that he had been to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>church, bowed his head devoutly, and folded his arms on his breast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He explained to Vassilissa that he had done his duty in fulfilling his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>vow. She looked at him in perturbation, for in her anxieties about her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mistress and in the preparations for the wedding she had not thought of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her own vow. Here was Yakob who had fulfilled his and was going about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with a pious jubilant air, and reminding her of her promised pilgrimage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Kiev.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't feel strong enough," she complained. "I have hardly any bones</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in me, only flesh. Lord, have mercy on me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>For thirty years she had been steadily putting on flesh; she lived on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coffee, tea, bread, potatoes and gherkins, and often fish, even at those</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>times of the year when meat was permitted. In her distress she went to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Father Vassili, to ask him to set her doubts at rest. She had heard that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kind priests were willing to release people from their vows or to allow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>substituted vows, where weakness of body hindered the performance of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>original.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As you agreed to go, you must go," said Father Vassili.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I agreed because I was frightened, Little Father. I thought that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mistress would die, but she was well again in three days; why then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should I make the long journey?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, there is no short road to Kiev. If you had no inclination to go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you should not have registered the vow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The inclination is there, but strength fails me. I suffer from want of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>breath even when I go to church. I am already in my seventh decade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Father. It would be different if Mistress had been three months in bed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if she had received the sacraments and the last unction, and then had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been restored to health by God in answer to my prayer; then I would have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gone to Kiev on my hands and knees."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Well, what is to be done?" asked Father Vassili, smiling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Now I should like to promise something different. I will lay a fast on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>myself, never to eat another bit of meat until I die."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you like meat?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I can't bear the sight of it, and have weaned myself from eating it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A difficult vow," said Father Vassili with another smile, "must be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>replaced by something as difficult or more difficult, but you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chosen the easiest. Isn't there anything that it would be hard for you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to carry out? Think again!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilissa thought, and said there was nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Very well then, you must go to Kiev."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I would gladly go, if I were not so stout."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How can your vow be eased?" said Father Vassili, thinking aloud. "What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do you live on?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"On tea, coffee, mushroom soup, potatoes...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you like coffee?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Little Father."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Abstain from coffee."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is nearly as bad," she sighed, "as going to Kiev. What am I to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>live on?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"On meat."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It seemed to her that he was laughing, and indeed he did laugh when he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>saw her face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You don't like it," he said. "But make the sacrifice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What good does it do me, and to eat meat is not fasting, Father."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Eat it on the days when it may be eaten. The good it will do is that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you will lay on less fat. In six months you are absolved of your vow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She went away in some distress, and began to execute the priest's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>instructions the next day, turning her nose sadly away from the steaming</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coffee that she brought her mistress in the morning.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In about ten days Marfinka returned in company with her fiancИ and his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mother. Vikentev and she brought their laughter, their gaiety and their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>merry talk into the quiet house. But within a couple of hours after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>their arrival they had become quiet and timid, for their gaiety had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>aroused a melancholy echo, as in an empty house. A mist lay on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everything. Even the birds had ceased to fly to the spot where Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fed them; swallows, starlings and all the feathered inhabitants of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>park were gone, and not a stork was to be seen flying over the Volga.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The gardener had thrown away the withered flowers; the space in front of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the house, usually radiant and sweet with flowers, now showed black</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rings of newly-dug earth framed in yellowish grass. The branches of some</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the trees had been enveloped in bast, and the trees in the park</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>became barer with every day. The Volga grew darker and darker, as if the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>river were preparing for its icy winter sleep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Nature does not create, but it does emphasise human melancholy. Marfinka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked herself what had happened to everybody in the house, as she looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>doubtfully round her. Even her own pretty little room did not look so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gay; it was as if Vera's nervous silence had invaded it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears. Why was everything so different? Why had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Veroshka come over from the other house, and why did she walk no more in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the field or in the thicket? Where was Tiet Nikonich?</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>They all looked worried, and hardly spoke to one another; they did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>even tease Marfinka and her fiancИ. Vera and grandmother were silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>What had happened to the whole house? It was the first trouble that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka had encountered in her happy life, and she fell in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unconsciously with the serious, dull tone that obtained in Malinovka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Silence, reserve and melancholy were equally foreign to Vikentev's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nature. He urged his mother to persuade Tatiana Markovna to allow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka to go back with them to Kolchino until the wedding at the end</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of October. To his surprise permission was given easily and quickly, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the young people flew like swallows from autumn to the warmth, light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and brightness of their future home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky drove over to fetch Tiet Nikonich. He was haggard and yellow, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly stirred from his place, and he only gradually recovered, like a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>child whose toys have been restored to him, when he saw Tatiana Markovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in her usual surroundings and found himself in the middle of the picture,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>either at table with his serviette tucked in his collar, or in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>window on the stool near her chair, with a cup of tea before him poured</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out by her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Another member was added to the family circle at Malinovka, for Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>brought Koslov to dinner one day, to receive the heartiest of welcomes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna had the tact not to let the poor forsaken man see that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she was aware of his trouble. She greeted him with a jest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why have you not been near us for so long, Leonti Ivanovich? Borushka</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>says that I don't know how to entertain you, and that you don't like my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table. Did you tell him so?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should I not like it? When did I say such a thing?" he asked Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>severely. "You are joking!" he went on, as everybody laughed, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>himself had to smile.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had had time to find his own bearings, and had begun to realise the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>necessity of hiding his grief from others.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, it is a long time since I was here. My wife has gone to Moscow to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>visit her relations, so that I could not...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You ought to have come straight to us," observed Tatiana Markovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"when it was so dull by yourself at home."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I expect her, and am always afraid she may come when I am not at home."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You would soon hear of her arrival, and she must pass our house. From</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the windows of the old house we can see who comes along the road, and we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will stop her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is true that the road to Moscow can be seen from there," said Koslov,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking quickly, and almost happily, at his hostess.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Come and stay with us," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I simply will not let you go to-day," said Raisky. "I am bored by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>myself, and we will move over into the old house. After Marfinka's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wedding I am going away, and you will be Grandmother's and Vera's first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>minister, friend and protector."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thank you. If I am not in the way...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How can you talk like that. You ought to be ashamed of yourself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgive me, Tatiana Markovna."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Better eat your dinner; the soup is getting cold."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am hungry too," he said suddenly, seizing his spoon. He ate his soup</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silently, looking round him as if he were seeking the road to Moscow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and he preserved the same demeanour all through the meal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is so quiet here," he said after dinner, as he looked out of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>window. "There is still some green left, and the air is so fresh. Listen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Boris Pavlovich, I should like to bring the library here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"As you like. To-morrow, as far as I am concerned. It is your possession</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to do as you please with."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What should I do with it now? I will have it brought over, so that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>can take care of it; else in the end that man Mark will...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky strode about the room, Vera's eyes were fixed on her needlework,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Tatiana Markovna went to the window. Shortly after this Raisky took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti to the old house, to show him the room that Tatiana Markovna had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arranged for him. Leonti went from one window to another to see which of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them commanded a view of the Moscow road.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXXII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>On a misty autumn day, as Vera sat at work in her room, Yakob brought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her a letter written on blue paper, which had been brought by a lad who</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had instructions to wait for an answer. When she had recovered from the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>first shock at the sight of the letter, she took it, laid it on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>table, and dismissed Yakob. She tried to go on with her work but her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hands fell helplessly on her lap.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When will there be an end of this torture?" she whispered, nervously.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then she took from her bureau the earlier unopened blue letter, laid it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by the side of the other, and covered her face with her hands. What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>answer could he expect from her, she asked herself, when they had parted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for ever? Surely he dare not call her once more. If so, an answer must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be given, for the messenger was waiting. She opened the letters and read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the earlier one:--</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are we really not to meet again, Vera? That would be incredible. A few</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>days ago there would have been reason in our separation, now it is a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>useless sacrifice, hard for both of us. We have striven obstinately with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one another for a whole year for the prize of happiness; and now that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the goal is attained you run away. Yet it is you who spoke of an eternal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>love. Is that logical?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Logical!" she repeated, but she collected her courage and read on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am now permitted to choose another place of residence. But now I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cannot leave you, for it would be dishonourable. You cannot think that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>am proud of my victory, and that it is easy for me to go away. I cannot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>allow you to harbour such an idea. I cannot leave you, because you love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Once more she interrupted her reading, but resumed it with an effort--</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And because my whole being is in a fever. Let us be happy, Vera. Be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>convinced that our conflict, our quarrelling was nothing but the mask of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passion. The mask has fallen, and we have no other ground of dispute. In</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reality we have long been one. You ask for a love which shall be eternal;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>many desire that, but it is an impossibility."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She stopped her reading to tell herself with a pitying smile that his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>conception of love was of a perpetual fever.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"My mistake was in openly asserting this truth, which life itself would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have revealed in due course. From this time onwards, I will not assail</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your convictions, for it is not they, but passion, which is the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>essential factor in our situation. Let us enjoy our happiness in silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I hope that you will agree to this logical solution."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera smiled bitterly as she continued to read.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"They would hardly allow you to go away with me, and indeed that is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hardly possible. Nothing but a wild passion could lead you to do such a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thing, and I do not expect it. Other convictions, indifferent to me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would be needed to impel you to this course; you would be faced with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>future which fulfils neither your own wishes nor the demands of your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>relations, for mine is an uncertain existence, without home, hearth or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>possessions. But if you think you can persuade your Grandmother, we will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be betrothed, and I will remain here until--for an indefinite time. A</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>separation now would be like a bad comedy, in which the unprofitable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>role is yours, at which Raisky, when he hears of it, will be the first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to laugh. I warn you again now, as I did before. Send your reply to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>address of my landlady, Sekletaia Burdalakov."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In spite of her exhaustion after reading this epistle Vera took up the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one which Yakob had just brought. It was hastily written in pencil.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Every day I have been wandering about by the precipice, hoping to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you in answer to my earlier letter. I have only just heard by chance of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your indisposition. Come, Vera. If you are ill, write two words, and I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will come myself to the old house. If I receive no answer to-day, I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>expect you to-morrow at five o'clock in the arbour. I must know quickly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whether I should go or stay. But I do not think we shall part. In any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>case, I expect either you or an answer. If you are ill, I will make my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>way into your house."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Terrified by his threat of coming, she seized pen and paper, but her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hands trembled too much to allow her to write.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot," she exclaimed. "I have no strength, I am stifled! How shall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I begin, and what can I write? I have forgotten how I used to write to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him, to speak to him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She sent for Yakob, and told him to dismiss the messenger and to say</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that an answer would follow later. She wondered as she walked slowly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back to her room, when she would find strength that day to write to him;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what she should say. She could only repeat that she could not, and would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not, and to-morrow she told herself, he would wait for her in the arbour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he would be wild with disappointment, and if he repeats his signals with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the rifle he will come into conflict with the servants, and eventually</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with grandmother herself. She tried to write, but threw the pen aside;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then she thought she would go to him herself, tell him all she had to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>say, and then leave him. As once before her hands sought in vain her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mantilla, her scarf, and without knowing what she did, she sank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>helplessly down on the divan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>If she told her grandmother the necessary steps would be taken, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>otherwise the letters would begin again. Or should she send her cousin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who was after all her natural and nearest friend and protector, to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>convince Mark that there was no hope for him? But she considered that he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>also was in the toils of passion, and that it would be hard for him to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>execute the mission, that he might be involved in a heated dispute,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which might develop into a dangerous situation. She turned to Tushin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whom she could trust to accomplish the errand effectively without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blundering. But it seemed impossible to set Tushin face to face with the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rival who had robbed him of his desires. Yet she saw no alternative. No</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>delay was possible; to-morrow would bring another letter, and then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>failing an answer, Mark himself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After brief consideration, she wrote a note to Tushin, and this time the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>same pen covered easily and quickly the same paper that had been so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>impracticable half an hour before. She asked him to come and see her the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>next morning.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Until now Vera had been accustomed to guard her own secrets, and to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>exercise an undivided rule in the world of her thoughts. If she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>given her confidence to the priest's wife, it was out of charity. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had confided to her the calendar of her everyday life, its events, its</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>emotions and impressions; she had told her of her secret meetings with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark, but concealed from her the catastrophe, telling her simply that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all was over between them. As the priest's wife was ignorant of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dИnouement of the story at the foot of the precipice, she put down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's illness to grief at their parting.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera loved Marfinka as she loved Natalie Ivanovna, not as a comrade, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>as a child. In more peaceful times she would again confide the details</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of her life to Natalie Ivanovna as before; but in a crisis she went to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna, sent for Tushin, or sought help from her cousin Boris.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now she put the letters in her pocket, found her aunt, and sat down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beside her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What has happened, Vera? You are upset."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not upset, but worried. I have received letters, from _there_."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"From _there_!" repeated Tatiana Markovna, turning pale.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The first was written some time ago, but I have only just opened it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the second was brought to me to-day," she said, laying them both on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the table.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You want me to know what is in them?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Read them, Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna put on her glasses, and tried to read them, but she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>found that she could not decipher them, and eventually Vera had to read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them. She read in a whisper, suppressing a phrase here and there; then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she crumpled them up and put them back in her pocket.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you think, Veroshka?" asked Tatiana Markovna, uncertainly. "He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is willing to be betrothed and to remain here. Perhaps if he is prepared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to live like other people, if he loves you, and if you think you could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be happy--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He calls betrothal a comedy, and yet suggests it. He thinks that only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that is needed to make me happy. Grandmother, you know my frame of mind;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so why do you ask me?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You came to me to ask me what you should decide," began Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna with some hesitation, as she did not yet understand why Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had read her the letters. She was incensed at Mark's audacity, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feared that Vera herself might be seized with a return of her passion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>For these reasons she concealed her anxiety.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It was not for that that I came to you, Grandmother. You know that my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mind has long been made up. I will have no more to do with him. And if I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>am to breathe freely again, and to hope to be able to live once more, it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is under the condition that I hear nothing of him, that I can forget</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>everything. He reminds me of what has happened, calls me down there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seeks to allure me with talk of happiness, will marry me.... Gracious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heaven! Understand, Grandmother," she went on, as Tatiana Markovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anxiety could no longer be concealed, "that if by a miracle he now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>became the man I hoped he would be, if he now were to believe all that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>believe, and loved me as I desired to love him, even if all this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happened I would not turn aside from my path at his call." No song could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>have been sweeter to the ears of Tatiana Markovna. "I should not be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happy with him," Vera continued. "I could never forget what he had been,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or believe in the new Mark. I have endured more than enough to kill any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>passion. There is nothing left in my heart but a cold emptiness, and but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for you, Grandmother, I should despair."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She wept convulsively, her head pressed against her aunt's shoulder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not recall your sufferings, Veroshka, and do not distress yourself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unnecessarily. We agreed never to speak of it again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But for the letters I should not have spoken, for I need peace. Take me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>away, Grandmother, hide me, or I shall die. He calls me--to that place."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna rose and drew Vera into the armchair, while she drew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself to her full height.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If that is so," she said, "if he thinks he can continue to annoy you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he will have to reckon with me. I will shield and protect you. Console</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself, child, you will hear no more of him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What will you do?" she asked in amazement, springing from her chair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He summons you. Well, I will go to the rendezvous in your place, and we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will see if he calls you any more, or comes here, or writes to you." She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strode up and down the room trembling with anger. "At what time does he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>go to the arbour to-morrow. At five, I think?" she asked sharply.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother, you don't understand," said Vera gently, taking her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Calm yourself. I make no accusation against him. Never forget that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alone am guilty. He does not know what has happened to me during these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>days, and therefore he writes. Now it is necessary to explain to him how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ill and spiritless I am, and you want to fight. I don't wish that. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would have written to him, but could not; and I have not the strength to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>see him. I would have asked Ivan Ivanovich, but you know how he cares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for me and what hopes he cherishes. To bring him into contact with a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who has destroyed those hopes is impossible."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Impossible," agreed Tatiana Markovna. "God knows what might happen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>between them. You have a near relation, who knows all and loves you like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a sister, Borushka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If that were how he loved me," thought Vera. She did not mean to reveal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky's passion for her, which remained her secret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Perhaps I will ask my cousin," she said. "Or I will collect my strength,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and answer the letter myself, so as to make him understand my position</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and renounce all hope. But in the mean time, I must let him know so that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he does not come to the arbour to wait in vain for me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will do that," struck in Tatiana Markovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But you will not go yourself?" asked Vera, looking direct into her eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Remember that I make no complaint against him, and wish him no evil."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Nor do I," returned her aunt, looking away. "You may be assured I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not go myself, but I will arrange it so that he does not await you in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the arbour."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgive me, Grandmother, for this fresh disturbance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna sighed, and kissed her niece. Vera left the room in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>calmer frame of mind, wondering what means her aunt proposed to take to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>prevent Mark from coming next day to the arbour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Next day at noon Vera heard horse's hoofs at the gate. When she looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>out of the window her eyes shone with pleasure for a moment, as she saw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin ride into the courtyard. She went to meet him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I saw you from the window," she said, adding, as she looked at him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you well?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What else should I be?" he answered with embarrassment, turning his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head away so that she should not notice the signs of suffering on his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face. "And you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I fell ill, and my illness might have taken an ill turn, but now it is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over. Where is Grandmother?" she asked, turning to Vassilissa.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The Mistress went out after tea, and took Savili with her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera invited Tushin to her room, but for the moment both were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>embarrassed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Have you forgiven me?" asked Vera after a pause, without looking at him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgiven you?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For all you have endured. Ivan Ivanovich, you have changed. I can see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that you carry a heavy heart. Your suffering and Grandmother's is a hard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>penance for me. But for you three, Grandmother, you, and Cousin Boris,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I could not survive."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And yet you say that you give us pain. Look at me; I think I am better</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>already. If you would only recover your own peace of mind it will all be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over and forgotten."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I had begun to recover, and to forget. Marfinka's marriage is close at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hand, there was a great deal to do and my attention was distracted, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yesterday I was violently excited, and am not quite calm now."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What has happened? Can I serve you, Vera Vassilievna?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot accept your service."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Because you do not think me able...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not that. You know all that has happened; read what I have received,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she said, taking the letters from a box, and handing them to him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin read, and turned as pale as he had been when he arrived.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are right. In this matter my assistance is superfluous. You alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>can...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot, Ivan Ivanovich," she said, while he looked at her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>interrogatively. "I can neither write a word to him, nor see him; yet I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>must give him an answer. He will wait there in the arbour, or if I leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him without an answer he will come here, and I can do nothing."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What kind of answer?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You ask the same question as Grandmother. Yet you have read the letter!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He promises me happiness, will submit to a betrothal. Yesterday I tried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to write to him to tell him that I was not happy, and should not be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happy after betrothal, and to bid him farewell. But I cannot put these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lines on paper, and I cannot commission anyone to deliver my answer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother flared up when she read the letter, and I fear she would not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be able to restrain her feelings. So I...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You thought of me," said Tushin, standing up. "Tushin, you thought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would do you this service, and then you sent for me." Pride, joy, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affection shone in his eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, Ivan Ivanovich. I sent for you, so that you might be at my side in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these difficult hours. I am calmer when you are here. But I will not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>send you--down there, I will not inflict on you this last insult, will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not set you face to face with a man, who cannot be an object of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>indifference to you--no, no."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin was about to speak, but instead he stretched out his hands in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>silence, and Vera looked at him with mixed feelings of gratitude and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sorrow, as she realised with what small things he was made happy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Insult!" he said. "It would have been hard to bear if you were to send</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me to him with an olive branch, to bring him up here from the depths of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the precipice. But even though that dove-like errand would not suit me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I would still undertake it to give you peace, if I thought it would make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you happy."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ivan Ivanovich," replied Vera, hardly restraining her tears, "I believe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you would have done it, but I would never send you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But now I am not asked to go outside my rТle of Bear; to tell him what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you cannot write to him, Vera Vassilievna, would give me happiness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She reflected that this was all the happiness with which she had to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reward him, and dropped her eyes. His mood changed when he noticed her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thoughtful, melancholy air; his proud bearing, the gleam in his eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the colour in his face disappeared. He regretted his incautious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>display of pleasure. It seemed to him that his delight and his mention</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of the word "happiness!" had been tantamount to a renewal of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>profession of love and the offer of his hand, and had betrayed to her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the fact that he rejoiced selfishly at her breach with Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera guessed that he was deceiving himself once more. Her heart, her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feminine instinct, her friendship, these things prevented Tushin from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>abandoning his hope; she gave what she could, an unconditional trust and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a boundless esteem.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, Ivan Ivanovich, I see now that I have placed my hopes on you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>though I did not confess it to myself, and no one would have persuaded</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me to ask this service of you. But since you make the generous offer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself, I am delighted, and thank you with all my heart. No one can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>help me as you do, because no one else loves me as you do."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You spoil me, Vera Vassilievna, when you talk like that. But it is true;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you read my very soul."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Will it not be hard for you to see him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, I shan't faint," he smiled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go at five o'clock to the arbour and tell him...." She considered a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>moment, then scribbled with a pencil what she had said she wished to say</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without adding a word. "Here is my answer," she said, handing him the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>open envelope. "You may add anything you think necessary, for you know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all. And don't forget, Ivan Ivanovich, that I blame him for nothing, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consequently," she added, looking away, "you may leave your whip</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>behind."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Very well," he said between his teeth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgive me," said Vera, offering her hand. "I do not say it as a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reproach. I breathe more freely now that I have told you what I wish,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and what I don't wish in your interview."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you thought I needed the hint?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pardon a sick woman," she said, and he pressed her hand again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXXIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>A little later Tatiana Markovna and Raisky returned to the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky and Tushin were embarrassed in one another's presence, and found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it difficult to talk naturally about the simplest things. But at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dinner-table the real sympathy between them conquered the awkwardness of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the situation. They looked one another straight in the eyes and read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>there a mutual confidence. After dinner Raisky went to his room, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin excused himself on the ground of business. Vera's thoughts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>followed him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>It was nearly five o'clock when he was trying to find his direction in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the thicket. Although he was no stranger there he seemed not to be able</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to find what he sought; he looked from side to side where the bushes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>grew more thickly, certain that he must be in the neighbourhood of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arbour. He stood still and looked impatiently at his watch. It was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nearly five o'clock, and neither the arbour nor Mark were visible.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Suddenly he heard a rustle in the distance, and among the young pines a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>figure appeared and disappeared alternately. Mark was approaching, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reached the place where Tushin was standing. They looked at one another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a full minute when they met.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Where is the arbour?" said Mark at last.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I don't exactly know in which direction...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In which direction? We are standing on the spot where it was still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>standing yesterday morning."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The arbour had vanished to allow of the literal carrying out of Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna's promise that Mark should not wait for Vera in the arbour. An</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hour after her conversation with Vera she had descended the precipice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accompanied by Savili and five peasants with axes, and within two hours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the arbour had been carried away, the peasant women and children helping</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to remove beams and boards. Next day the site of the arbour was levelled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>covered with turf, and planted with young fir trees. "If I had had the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arbour removed before," thought Tatiana Markovna regretfully, "the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rascal would have noticed it, and would not have written her the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>letters."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The situation was clear enough to the "rascal" now. "That is the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lady's handiwork," he thought, when he saw the young fir trees. "Her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera, like a well-bred young woman, has told her the whole story." He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nodded to Tushin, and was turning away, when he saw his rival's eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>were fixed on him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you out for a stroll?" said Mark. "Why do you look at me in that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>extraordinary fashion? I suppose you are visiting at Malinovka."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin replied drily and politely that he was a visitor at the house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and had come down especially to see Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To see me?" asked Mark quickly with a look of inquiry. Has he heard too?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he wondered. He remembered that Tushin admired Vera and wondered whether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the "Forest Othello" was meditating tragedy and murder on the green.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have a commission for you," said Tushin, handing him the letter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Without betraying any sense of discomfort, or any sign of pain or rage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark read it rapidly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you know the whole story?" he asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Allow me to leave that question unanswered, and instead to ask you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whether you have any answer to give," said Tushin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark shook his head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I take it for granted, that, in accordance with her wish, you will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leave her in peace in the future, that you will not remind her of your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>existence in any way, will not write to her, nor visit this place...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What business is it of yours?" asked Mark. "Are you her declared lover,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that you make these demands?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"One does not need to be her fiancИ to execute a commission; it is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sufficient to be a friend."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And if I do write, or do come here, what then?" cried Mark angrily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I cannot say how Vera Vassilievna would take it, but if she gives me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another commission, I will undertake it," said Tushin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You are an obedient friend," observed Mark maliciously.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Yes, I am her friend," replied Tushin seriously. "I thought her wish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would be law to you too. She is just beginning to recover from a serious</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>illness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the matter with her?" said Mark, gently for him. As he received</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no answer he went on, "Excuse my outburst, but you see my agitation."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Calmness is desirable for you too. Is there any answer to this letter?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do not need your assistance for that. I will write."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She will not receive your letter. Her state of health necessitates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quiet, which she cannot have if you force yourself on her. I tell you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>what was told me, and what I have seen for myself."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you wish her well?" asked Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You see that she loves me. She has told you so."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She has not said so to me; indeed she never spoke of love. She gave me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the letter I handed you, and asked me to make it clear that she did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wish, and was not indeed in a condition to see you or to receive any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>letter from you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How ridiculous to make herself and other people suffer. If you are her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friend you can relieve her of her misery, her illness, and her collapse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of strength. The old lady has broken down the arbour, but she has not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>destroyed passion, and passion will break Vera. You say yourself she is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ill."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I did not say that passion was the cause of her illness."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What can have made her ill?" asked Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your letters. You expect her in the arbour, and threaten to come to her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself. That she cannot endure, and has asked me to tell you so."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She says that, but in reality...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She always speaks the truth."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why did she give you this commission?" Receiving no answer, Mark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>continued: "You have her confidence, and can therefore tell her how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strange it is to refuse happiness. Advise her to put an end to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wretched situation, to renounce her Grandmother's morality, and then I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>propose...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you understood Vera Vassilievna, you would know that hers is one of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>those natures that declines explanations and advice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You execute your errands most brilliantly and diplomatically," said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark angrily.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin looked at him without replying, and his calm silence enraged Mark.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He saw in the disappearance of the arbour and the appearance on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>scene of Tushin as a mediator, the certain end of his hopes. Vera's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hesitation was over, and she was now firmly determined on separation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He was enraged by his consciousness that Vera's illness was really not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the result of her infatuation for him, which she would not have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>confessed to her aunt, much less to Tushin. Mark knew her obstinacy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which resisted even the flame of passion, and on that very account he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had, almost in despair, resigned himself to submit to a formal betrothal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and had communicated his decision to her, had consented to remain in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>town indefinitely, that is, so long as the tie between them held.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Convinced of the truth of his conception of love, he foresaw that in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>course of time passion would grow cool and disappear, that they would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not for ever be held by it, and then.... Then, he was convinced, Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would herself recognise the situation, and acquiesce in the consequences.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now his offer had become superfluous; no one was prepared to accept</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it, and he was simply to be dismissed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do not know what to do," he said proudly. "I cannot find any answer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to your diplomatic mission. Naturally, I shall not again visit the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>arbour, as it has ceased to exist."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And you will write no more letters either," added Tushin, "as they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would not in any case reach her. Neither will you come to the house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where you would not be admitted."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Are you her guardian?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That would depend on Vera Vassilievna's wishes. There is a mistress of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the house who commands her servants. I take it that you accept the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>facts."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The devil knows," cried Mark, "how ridiculous all this is. Mankind have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>forged chains for themselves, and make martyrs of themselves." Although</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he still justified himself in making no reply, he felt that his position</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was untenable. "I am leaving the place shortly," he said, "in about a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>week's time. Can I not see Vera--Vassilievna for a minute?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That cannot be arranged, because she is ill."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Is any pressure being put upon her?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She requires only one medicine--not to be reminded of you."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do not place entire confidence in you, because you do not appear to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>me to be an indifferent party."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin did not answer in the same tone. He understood Mark's feeling of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bitter disillusion, and made another attempt at conciliation. "If you do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not trust me," he said, "you hold the evidence in your hand."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A dismissal. Yes, but that proves nothing. Passion is a sea, where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>storm reigns to-day, and tomorrow dead calm. Perhaps she already repents</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>having sent this."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I think not. She takes counsel with herself before acting. It is plain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from your last words that you don't understand Vera Vassilievna. You</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will, of course, act in accordance with her wishes. I will not insist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>any more on an answer."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is no answer to give. I am going away."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is an answer."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It is not she who needs an answer, but you, the romantic Raisky, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the old lady."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why not include the whole town! But I will take on myself to assure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera Vassilievna that your answer will be literally carried out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Farewell."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Farewell ... Sir Knight."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin frowned slightly, touched his cap, and was gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mark's face was very pale. He recognised bitterly that he was beaten,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that his romance ended here at the foot of the precipice, which he must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leave without once turning round, with no pity, no word of farewell to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>speed him; he was bidden to go as if he were a contemptible enemy. Why</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had all this come about? He was not conscious of any fault. Why should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he part from her like this. She could not pretend that he had been the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cause of what old-fashioned people would call her "fall." He had gone so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>far as to belie his own convictions, to neglect his mission, and was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>even prepared to contemplate marriage. Yet he received a laconic note</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>instead of a friendly letter, a go-between instead of herself. It was as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if he had been struck with a knife, and a cold shiver ran through his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>body. It was not the old lady who had invented these measures, for Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>did not allow others to dictate to her. It must have been she herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>What had he done, and why should she act with such severity?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He went slowly away. When he reached the fence he swung himself on to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the top and sat there, asking himself again where his fault lay. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remembered that at their last meeting he had fairly warned her. He had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said in effect: "Remember that I have warned you. If you stretch out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your hand to me you are mine, and the responsibility for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>consequences rests with you; I am innocent." That was surely logical, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>thought. Suddenly he sprang down on to the road, and went without</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looking back. He remembered how at this very spot he had prepared to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leave her. But he heard her nervous, despairing cry of farewell, and had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then looked round and rushed to her. As he answered these questions his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>blood hammered in his veins. He strode up the hill. The knife had done</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>its work; it bored deeper and deeper. Memory pitilessly revived a series</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of fleeting pictures. The inner voice told him that he had not acted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>honourably, and spared her when her strength had failed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She used to call you a "Wolf" in jest, but the name will be no jest in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her memory, for you joined to the fierceness of a wolf a fox's cunning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and the malice of a yapping dog; there was nothing human about you. She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>took with her from the depths of the precipice nothing but a bitter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>memory and a lifelong sorrow. How could she be so blind as to be led</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>astray, to let herself be dazzled, to forget herself? You may triumph,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>for she will never forget you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He understood now the laconic note, her illness and the appearance of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin instead of herself at the foot of the precipice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti told Raisky that Mark had informed him that he was going to spend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some time with his old aunt in the government of Novgorod; he intended</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to enter the army once more as an ensign, in the hope of being sent to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Caucasus.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXXIV</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky and Tushin had been talking all the evening, and for the first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time in their lives observed one another closely, with the result that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>both felt a desire for a closer acquaintance. Tushin asked Raisky to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his guest for a week, to have a look at the forest, the steam-saw, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the timber industry. Raisky accepted, and the next day they crossed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>river together in Tushin's boat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's name did not cross their lips. Each was conscious that the other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knew his secret. Raisky in any case had learned of Tushin's offer, of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his behaviour on that occasion, and of his part in the whole drama from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera herself. His jealous prejudices had instantly vanished, and he felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nothing but esteem and sympathy for Tushin. As he studied the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>personality of Vera's friend, as his fancy did him its usual service of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>putting the object, not in itself a romantic one, in the best light, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>admired Tushin's simplicity and frankness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After a week spent at "Smoke," after seeing him at home, in the factory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in field and forest, after talking through the night with him by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>flickering light of the fire, he understood how Vera's eye and heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>should have recognised the simple completeness of the man and placed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin side by side with Tatiana Markovna and her sister in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affections. Raisky himself was attracted to this simple, gentle and yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strong personality, and would like to have stayed longer at "Smoke," but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna wrote asking him to return without delay as his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>presence was necessary at Malinovka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin offered to drive with him, for company's sake, as he said; in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reality he wanted to know why Tatiana Markovna had sent for Raisky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whether there was a new turn in Vera's affairs, or any service to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rendered her. He remembered uncomfortably his meeting with Mark, and how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unwillingly he had said that he was going away. Tushin wondered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>anxiously whether he had kept his promise, whether he was annoying Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in any way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Raisky reached Malinovka he hurried straight to Vera. While his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>impressions were still fresh, he drew in vivid colours a full length</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>portrait of Tushin, describing his surroundings and his activities with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sympathetic appreciation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera sighed, perhaps for sorrow that she did not love Tushin more and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>differently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky would have gone on talking about his visit if he had not had a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>message from his aunt that she would like to see him immediately. He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked Vera if she knew why he had been sent for.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I know something is wrong, but she has not told me, and I don't like to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ask. Indeed, I fear...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She broke off, and at that moment Tushin sent in word to know if she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would receive him. She assented.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Raisky entered her room, Tatiana Markovna dismissed Pashutka and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>locked the door. She looked worried and old, and her appearance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>terrified Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Has something disagreeable happened?" he asked, sitting down opposite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is done is done," she said sadly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am sitting on needles, Grandmother. Tell me quickly."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That old thief Tychkov has had his revenge on us both. He wormed out a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tale about me from a crazy old woman, but this has had no special</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>results, for people are indifferent to the past, and in any case I stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with one foot in the grave, and don't care about myself, but Vera--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What about Vera, Grandmother?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Her secret has ceased to be a secret. Rumours are going about the town.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At first I did not understand why on Sunday at church, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vice-governor's wife asked me twice after Vera's health, and why two other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ladies listened curiously for my answers. I looked round, and read on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>every face the same question, what was the matter with Vera? I said she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had been ill, but was better again. Then there were further questions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and I extricated myself with difficulty. The real misfortune, thank God,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is concealed. I learned from Tiet Nikonich yesterday, that the gossip is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the wrong track. Ivan Ivanovich is suspected. Do you remember that on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's birthday he said not a word, but sat there like a mute, until</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera came in, when he suddenly woke up. The guests, of course, noticed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>it. In any case it has long been no secret that he loves Vera, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>has no arts of concealment. People said that they vanished into the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>garden, that Vera went later to the old house and Tushin drove away. Do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you know what he came for?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky nodded.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Vera and Tushin are coupled together in everybody's mouth."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You said that Tychkov had dragged me in too."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Paulina Karpovna did that. She went out to find you in the evening when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you were out late with Vera. You said something to her, apparently in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>jest, which she understood in her own way, and she has involved you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>They say she had alienated you from Vera, with whom you were supposed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be in love, and she keeps on repeating that she dragged you from the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice. What had you to do with her, and what is the tale about Vera?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Perhaps you had been in her confidence for a long time, and you both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kept silence with me--this is what your freedom has brought you to." She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sighed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That silly old bird got off too easily," said Raisky, clenching his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fists. "To-morrow I will have it out with her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You have found someone whom you can call to account. What is the use of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reproaching her? She is ridiculous, and no one cares what she says. But</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the old chatterbox Tychkov has established that on Marfinka's birthday,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera and Tushin had a long conversation in the avenue, that the day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>before she stayed out far into the night, and was subsequently ill, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>he has put his own construction on Paulina Karpovna's tale. He is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>trumpeting it in the town that it was not with you, but with Tushin that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she was walking about at night. Then to crown all a drunken old woman</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made revelations about me. Tychkov has extracted everything...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana's eyes dropped, and her face flushed for a moment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is another story," said Raisky seriously, striding up and down the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>room. "The lesson you gave him was not sufficient. I will try a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>repetition of it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do you mean? God forbid that you should. You will try to prove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that the tale is not true, which is not difficult; it is only necessary</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to know where Ivan Ivanovich spent the evening before Marfinka's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>birthday. Supposing he was in his forest, then people will ask who was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with Vera in the park. The Kritzki woman saw you at the top of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice, and Vera was--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is to be done?" asked Raisky in fear for Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God's judgments are put in the mouths of men," whispered Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna sadly, "and they must not be despised. We must humble ourselves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and our cup is apparently not yet full."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Conscious of the difficulties of their position, both were silent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera's retired way of life, Tushin's devotion to her, her independence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of her aunt's authority, were familiar and accustomed facts. But</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky's attentions to her wrapped this simple situation in an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>uncertainty, which Paulina Karpovna had noticed, and had naturally not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>kept to herself. It was not only Tatiana Markovna who had marked out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin as Vera's probable husband. The town expected two great events,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's marriage with Vikentev which was about to take place, and, in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>no distant future, Tushin's marriage with Vera. Then suddenly there were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>these incomprehensible, unexpected happenings. On her sister's birthday</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera appeared among the guests only for a moment, hardly spoke to anyone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>then vanished into the garden with Tushin, and afterwards to the old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house, while Tushin left without even saying good-bye to his hostess.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paulina Markovna had related how Raisky, on the eve of the family</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>festival, had gone out for a walk with Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Following on this Vera had fallen ill, then Tatiana Markovna, no one was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>admitted to the house, Raisky wandered about like one possessed, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>doctors gave no definite report.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>There was no word or sign of a wedding. Why had Tushin not made his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>offer, and if he made it, why was it not accepted? People surmised that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had entrapped Vera; if so, why did he not marry her. They were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>determined to know who was wrong and who was right, and to give judgment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accordingly. Both Tatiana Markovna and Raisky were conscious of all this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and feared the verdict for Vera's sake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Grandmother," said Raisky at last, "you must tell Ivan Ivanovich this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>yourself, and be guided by what he says. I know his character now, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>am confident that he will decide on the right course. He loves Vera, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cares more for what happens to her than to himself. He came over the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volga with me because your letter to me made him anxious about Vera.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When you have talked this over with him, I will go to Paulina Karpovna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and perhaps see Tychkov as well."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am determined you shall not meet Tychkov."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I must," replied Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will not have it, Boris. No good can come of it. I will follow your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>advice and speak to Ivan Ivanovich; then we will see whether you need go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Paulina Karpovna. Ask Ivan Ivanovich to come here, but say not a word</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to Vera. She has heard nothing so far, and God grant that she never</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went to Vera, and his place with Tatiana Markovna was taken by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna could not disguise her agitation when Ivan Ivanovich</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>entered her room. He made his bow in silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How did you find Vera?" she asked, after a pause.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She seemed to be well and calm."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"God grant that she is! But how much trouble all this has caused you,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she added in a low voice, trying to avoid his eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What does that matter, if Vera Vassilievna has peace."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She was beginning to recover, and I too felt happier, so long as our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>distress was concealed." Tushin started as if he had been shot. "Ivan</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ivanovich," continued Tatiana Markovna, "there is all sorts of gossip in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the town. Borushka and I in a moment of anger tore the mask from that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hypocrite Tychkov--you have no doubt heard the story. Such an outburst</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ill fitted my years, but he had been blowing his own trumpet so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>abominably that it was unendurable. Now he, in his turn, is tearing the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mask from us."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"From you? I don't understand."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When he gossipped about me, no one took any heed, for I am already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>counted with my fathers. But with Vera it is different, and they have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dragged your name into the affair."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mine? with Vera Vassilievna's? Please tell me what the talk is."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Tatiana Markovna had told the story he asked what she wished him to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You must clear yourself," she said. "You have been beyond reproach all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your life, and must be again. As soon as Marfinka's wedding is over I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shall settle on my estate at Novosselovo for good. You should make haste</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to inform Tychkov that you were not in the town on the day before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's fЙte-day, and consequently could not have been at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>precipice."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It ought to be done differently."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do just as you like, Ivan Ivanovich. But what else can you say?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I would rather not meet Tychkov. He may have heard through others that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I certainly was in the town; I was spending a couple of days with a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>friend. I shall spread it about that I did visit the precipice on that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>evening with Vera Vassilievna, although that is not the case. I might</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>add that I had offered her my hand and had met with a refusal, by which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you, Tatiana Markovna, who gave me your approval, were aggrieved; that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera Vassilievna felt bitterly the breach of our friendship. One might</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>even speak of a distant hope ... of a promise...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"People will not be kept quiet by that, for a promise cannot always</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remain a promise."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"It will be forgotten, Tatiana Markovna, especially if you, as you say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>leave the neighbourhood. If it is not forgotten, and you and Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vassilievna are further disturbed, it is still possible," he added in a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>low tone, "to accept my proposal."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ivan Ivanovich," said Tatiana Markovna reproachfully, "do you think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera and I are capable of such a thing? Are we to avail ourselves of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your past affection and your generosity merely to still malicious gossip,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to stifle talk for which there is a basis of truth. Neither you nor Vera</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>would find happiness in that way."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"There is no question of generosity, Tatiana Markovna. If a forest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stands in one's way, it must he hewn down; bold men see no barrier in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the sea, and hew their way through the rock itself. Here there is no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>obstacle of forest, sea, or rock. I am bridging the precipice, and my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>feet will not tremble when I cross the bridge. Give me Vera Vassilievna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>No devil should disturb my happiness or her peace of mind, if she lived</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to be a hundred. She will be my Tsaritsa, and in the peace that reigns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in my forest will forget all that now oppresses her. You don't yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understand me!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I do," whispered Tatiana Markovna tearfully, "but the decision does not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>lie with me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He passed his hands across his eyes and through his thick hair, then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seized her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Forgive me, I forgot the important point. It is not mountain, forest or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sea, but an insurmountable obstacle that confronts me--Vera Vassilievna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is not willing. She looks forward to a happier future than I can offer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her. You sent for me to let me know of the gossip there is going about,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the view that it must be painful, didn't you? Do not let it disturb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>either yourself or Vera Vassilievna, but take her away, so that no word</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of it penetrates to her ears. In the meantime I will spread in the town</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the account we have discussed. That man," he could not bring Mark's name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>over his lips, "leaves the town to-morrow or the day after, and all will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>be forgotten. As for me, since it is decided that Vera Vassilievna is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not to be my wife, it does not matter whether I die or live."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna, pale and trembling, interrupted him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She will be your wife," she said, "when she has learnt to forget. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understand for the first time how you love Vera."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do not lure me on with false hopes, for I am not a boy. Who can give me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>security that Vera Vassilievna will ever...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I give you that security."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His eyes shone with gratitude as he took her hand. Tatiana Markovna felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that she had gone too far, and had promised more than she could perform.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She withdrew her hand, and said soothingly: "She is still very unhappy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and would not understand at present. First of all she must be left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>alone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I will wait and hope," he said in a low tone. "If only I might, like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vikentev, call you Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She signed to him to leave her. When he had gone she dropped on to her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>chair, and covered her face with her handkerchief.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXXV</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky had written to Paulina Karpovna asking her if he might call the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>next day about one o'clock. Her answer ran: "_CharmИe, j'attends...._"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and so on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He found her in her boudoir in a stifling atmosphere of burning incense,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with curtains drawn to produce a mysterious twilight. She wore a white</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>muslin frock with wide lace sleeves, with a yellow dahlia at her breast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Near the divan was placed a sumptuously spread table with covers for two.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky explained that he had come to make a farewell call.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A farewell call! I won't hear of such a thing. You are joking, it is a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bad joke! No, no! Smile and take back the hated word," she protested,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>slipping her arm in his and leading him to the table. "Don't think of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>going away. _Vive l'amour et la joie_."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>She invited him with a coquettish gesture to be seated, and hung a table</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>napkin over his coat, as she might to a child. He devoted an excellent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>morning appetite to the food before him. She poured out champagne for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>him and watched him with tender admiration.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After a longish pause when she had filled his glass for the third or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fourth time she said: "Well, what have you to say about it?" Then as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky looked at her in amazement she continued: "I see, I see! Take off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the mask, and have done with concealment."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah!" sighed Raisky, putting his lips to his glass. They drank to one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another's health.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Do you remember that night," she murmured, "the night of love as you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>called it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How should it fade from my memory," he whispered darkly. "That night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>was the decisive hour."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I knew it. A mere girl could not hold you ... _une nullitИ, cette</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pauvre petite fille, qui n'a que sa figure_ ... shy, inexperienced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>devoid of elegance."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She could not. I have torn myself free."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And have found what you have long been seeking, have you not? What</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happened in the park to excite you so?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>After a little fencing, Raisky proceeded with his story. "When I thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my happiness was within my grasp, I heard...."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tushin was there?" whispered Paulina Karpovna, holding her breath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He nodded silently, and raised his glass once more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"_Dites tout_," she said with a malicious smile.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She was walking alone, lost in thought," he said in a confidential tone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>while Paulina Karpovna played with her watch chain, and listened with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strained attention. "I was at her heels, determined to have an answer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from her. She took one or two steps down the face of the precipice, when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>someone suddenly came towards her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What did he do?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'Good evening, Vera Vassilievna,' he said. 'How do you do?' She</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>shuddered."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Hypocrisy!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Not at all. I hid myself and listened. 'What are you doing here?' she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said. 'I am spending two days in town,' he said, 'to be present at your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sister's fЙte, and I have chosen that day.... Decide, Vera Vassilievna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whether I am to love or not."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"_OЫ le sentiment va-t-il se nicher?_" exclaimed Paulina Karpovna.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Even in that clod."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'Ivan Ivanovich!' pleaded Vera," continued Raisky. "He interrupted her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with 'Vera Vassilievna, decide whether to-morrow I should ask Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna for your hand, or throw myself into the Volga!'"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Those were his words?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"His very words."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"_Mais, il est ridicule_. What did she do? She moaned, cried yes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and no?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"She answered, 'No, Ivan Ivanovich, give me time to consider whether I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>can respond with the same deep affection that you feel for me. Give me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>six months, a year, and then I will answer "yes" or "no."' Your room is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>so hot, Paulina Karpovna, could we have a little air?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky thought he had invented enough, and glanced up at his hostess,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who wore an expression of disappointment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"_C'est tout?_" she asked.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"_Oui_," he said. "In any case Tushin did not abandon hope. On the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>next day, Marfinka's birthday, he appeared again to hear her last word.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>From the precipice he went through the park, and she accompanied him. It</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>seems that next day his hopes revived. Mine are for ever gone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And that is all? People have been spreading God knows what tales about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your cousin--and you. They have not even spared that saint Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna with their poisonous tongues. That unendurable Tychkov!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky pricked up his ears. "They talk about Grandmother?" he asked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>waveringly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He remembered the hint Vera had given him of Tatiana Markovna's love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>story, and he had heard something from Vassilissa, but what woman has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not her romance? They must have dug up some lie or some gossip out of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the dust of forty years. He must know what it was in order to stop</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tychkov's mouth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What do they say about Grandmother?" he asked in a low, intimate voice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"_Ah, c'est degТutant_. No one believes it, and everybody is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>jeering at Tychkov for having debased himself to interrogate a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>drink-maddened old beggar-woman. I will not repeat it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If you please," he whispered tenderly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You wish to know?" she whispered, bending towards him. "Then you shall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hear everything. This woman, who stands regularly in the porch of the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Church of the Ascension, has been saying that Tiet Nikonich loved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna, and she him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I know that," he interrupted impatiently. "That is no crime."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And she was sought in marriage by the late Count Sergei Ivanovich--"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I have heard that, too. She did not agree, and the Count married</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>somebody else, but she was forbidden to marry Tiet Nikonich. I have been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>told all that by Vassilissa. What did the drunken woman say?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The Count is said to have surprised a rendezvous between Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna and Tiet Nikonich, and such a rendezvous.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no!" she cried, shaking with laughter. "Tatiana Markovna! Who would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>believe such a thing?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky listened seriously, and surmises flitted across his mind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The Count gave Tiet Nikonich a box on the ears."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"That is a lie," cried Raisky, jumping up. "Tiet Nikonich would not have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>endured it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A lie naturally--he did not endure it. He seized a garden knife that he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>found among the flowers, struck the Count to the ground, seized him by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the throat, and would have killed him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky's face changed. "Well?" he urged.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tatiana Markovna restrained his hand. 'You are' she said, 'a nobleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not a bandit, your weapon is a sword.' She succeeded in separating them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and a duel was not possible, for it would have compromised her. The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>opponents gave their word; the Count to keep silence over what had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>happened, and Tiet Nikonich not to marry Tatiana Markovna. That is why</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she remains unmarried. Is it not a shame to spread such calumnies?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky could no longer contain his agitation, but he said, "You see it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is a lie. Who could possibly have seen and heard what passed."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The gardener, who was asleep in a corner, is said to have witnessed the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whole scene. He was a serf, and fear ensured his silence, but he told</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his wife, the drunken widow who is now chattering about it. Of course it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is nonsense, incredible nonsense. I am the first to cry that it is a lie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a lie. Our respected and saintly Tatiana Markovna!" Paulina Karpovna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>burst out laughing, but checked herself when she looked at Raisky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What is the matter? _Allons donc, oubliez tout. Vive la joie!_ Do</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>not frown. We will send for more wine," she said, looking at him with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her ridiculous, languishing air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no, I am afraid--" He broke off, fearing to betray himself, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>concluded lamely, "It would not agree with me--I am not accustomed to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wine."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He rose from his seat, and his hostess followed his example.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Good-bye, for ever," he said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No, no," she cried.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I must escape from these dangerous places, from your precipices and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>abysses. Farewell, farewell!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He picked up his hat, and hurried away. Paulina Karpovna stood as if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>turned to stone, then rang the bell, and called for her carriage and for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her maid to dress her, saying she had calls to pay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky perceived that there was truth in the drunken woman's story, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that he held in his hand the key to his aunt's past. He realised now how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she had grown to be the woman she was, and where she had won her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strength, her practical wisdom, her knowledge of life and of men's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hearts; he understood why she had won Vera's confidence, and had been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>able to calm her niece in spite of her own distress. Perhaps Vera, too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>knew the story. While he had been manoeuvring to give another turn to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the gossip about Vera's relations to himself and Tushin, he had lighted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by chance on a forgotten but vivid page of his family history, on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>another drama no less dangerous to those who took part in it, and found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that his whole soul was moved by this record of what had happened forty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>years ago.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Borushka!" cried Tatiana Markovna in horror, when he entered her room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What has come to you, my friend? You have been drinking!" She looked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>keenly at him for a long minute, then turned away when she read in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>tell-tale face that he, too, had heard the talk about her past self.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXXVI</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Against universal expectation, Marfinka's wedding was a quiet one, no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one being invited except a few neighbouring landowners and the important</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>personages in the town, about fifty guests in all. The young people were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>married in the village church on Sunday, after morning service, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>afterwards in the hall, which had been transformed for the occasion, a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>formal breakfast was served without any of the gaiety and excitement</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>usual to such occasions. The servants were most disappointed, for their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mistress had taken precautions against their drinking to excess, which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>made the whole affair seem dull to them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka's trousseau and her contributions to the household had already</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>been taken across the Volga, the process having occupied a full week.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She herself shone with the charm of a rose grown to perfection; in her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>face a new emotion was visible which found expression now in a musing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>smile, now in a stray tear. Her face was shadowed with the consciousness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of a new life, of a far stretching future with unknown duties, a new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dignity and a new happiness. Vikentev wore an expression of modesty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>almost of timidity, and was visibly affected.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky looked at the pretty bride with the emotions of a brother, but he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had an impulse of terror when he noticed in her sheaf of orange blossom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>some faded blooms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"They are from the bouquet that Vera gave me for my birthday," she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>explained naively.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky pretended that withered flowers were a bad omen, and helped her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to pick them out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When the time for their departure came, the bride had to be literally</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>dragged sobbing from her aunt's breast, but her tears were tears of joy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna was pale, only maintaining her self-restraint with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>difficulty, and it was plain that she could only just stand as she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked out on the Volga after her departing child. Once at home again,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>she gave way to her tears. She knew that she possessed the almost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>undivided love of her other child, the passionate Vera, whose character</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had been ripened by bitter experience.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin stayed with a friend in the town for the wedding. Next day he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>came to Tatiana Markovna, accompanied by an architect, and they spent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nearly a week over plans, going over the two houses, the gardens and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>servants' quarters, making sketches and talking of radical alterations</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the spring. Everything of value--furniture, pictures, even the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>parquet flooring--had been taken out of the old house and stored, partly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the new house, partly in outhouses and on the ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna and Vera intended to go to Novosselovo, and later on to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>visit the Vikentevs; for the summer they were invited to be the guests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Anna Ivanovna, Tushin's sister, at "Smoke." Tatiana Markovna had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>given no definite answer to the suggestion, saying that it must be "as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>God wills." In any case Tushin was making the necessary arrangements</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with the architect, and intended to make extensive alterations in his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>house for the reception of the honoured visitors.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky stayed in his rooms in the new house, but Leonti had returned to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his own home for the time being, to return to Malinovka after the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>departure of Tatiana Markovna and Vera. He, too, had been invited by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin to "Smoke," but Leonti had answered with a sigh, "Later in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>winter. Just now I am expecting...." and had broken off to look out on to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the road from Moscow. He was in fact expecting a letter from his wife in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>answer to one he had just written. Not long before, Juliana Andreevna</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>had written to their housekeeper and had asked her to send her winter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>cloak. She indicated the address, but said not a word about her husband.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti dispatched the cloak himself with a glowing letter in which he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>asked her to come, and spoke of his love and friendship.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The poor man received no reply. Gradually he resumed his teaching,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>though he still betrayed his melancholy now and again during the lessons,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and was apt to be absentminded and unconscious of the behaviour of his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>scholars, who took pitiless advantage of his helplessness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tushin had offered to look after Malinovka during Tatiana Markovna's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>absence. He called it his winter quarters and made a point of crossing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the Volga every week to give an eye to the house, the farm yard and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>servants, of whom only Vassilissa, Egor, the cook and the coachman</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accompanied their mistress to Novosselovo. Yakob and Savili were put</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>especially at Tushin's disposition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky proposed to leave a week after the wedding.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tiet Nikonich was in the most melancholy plight of all. At any other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time he would have followed Tatiana Markovna to the end of the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but after the outbreak of gossip it would have been unsuitable to follow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her for the moment, because it might have given colour to the talk about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them which was half-believed and already partly forgotten. Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna, however, said he might come at Christmas, and by that time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>perhaps circumstances would permit him to stay. In the meantime, he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>accepted Tushin's invitation to be his guest at "Smoke."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The gossip about Vera had given ground to the universal expectation of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>her marriage with Tushin. Tatiana Markovna hoped that time would heal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>all her wounds, but she recognised that Vera's case stood in a category</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>by itself, and that ordinary rules did not apply to it. No rumour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>reached Vera, who continued to see in Tushin the friend of long standing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>who was all the dearer to her since he had stretched out to her his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>helping hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the last days before his departure Raisky had gone through and sorted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his sketches and notebooks, and had selected from his novel those pages</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which bore reference to Vera. In the last night that he spent under the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>roof of home he decided to begin his plot then and there, and sat down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to his writing-table. He determined that one chapter at least should be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>written. "When my passion is past," he told himself, "when I no longer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>stand in the presence of these men, with their comedy and their tragedy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the picture will be clearer and in perspective. I already see the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>splendid form emerge fresh from the hand of its creator, I see my statue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whose majesty is undefiled by the common and the mean." He rose, walked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>up and down the room, and thought over the first chapter. After half an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>hour's meditation he sat down and rested his head on his hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Weariness invaded him, and as it was uncomfortable to doze in a sitting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>posture he lay down on the sofa. Very soon he fell asleep, and there was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a sound of regular breathing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>When he woke it was beginning to get light. He sprang up hastily and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>looked round in astonishment, as if he had seen something new and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>unexpected in his dreams.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In my dream, even, I saw a statue," he said to himself. "What does it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mean? Is it an omen?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He went to the table, read the introduction he had written, and sighed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What use do I make of my powers?" he cried. "Another year is gone." He</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>angrily thrust the manuscript aside to look for a letter he had received</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>a month ago from the sculptor Kirilov, and sat down at the table to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>answer it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"In my sound and clear mind, dear Kirilov, I hasten to give you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the first intimation of the new and unexpected perspective of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>my art and my activity. I write in answer to the letter in which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you tell me that you are going to visit Italy and Rome. I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>coming to St. Petersburg; so for God's sake wait for me and I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will travel with you. Take me with you, and have pity on a blind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>insane individual, who has only to-day had his eyes opened to his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>real calling. I have groped about in the darkness for a long time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and have very nearly committed suicide, that is, let my talent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>perish. You discovered talent in my pictures, but instead of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>devoting myself solely to my brush I have dabbled in music, in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>literature--have dissipated my energies. I meant to write a novel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and neither you nor anybody else prevented me and told me that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>am a sculptor, a classical artist. A Venus of living marble is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>born of my imagination. Is it then my cue to introduce psychology</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>into my pictures, to describe manners and customs? Surely not, my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>art is concerned with form and beauty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For the novelist quite other qualities are required, and years</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of labour are necessary. I would spare neither time nor endeavour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>if I thought that my talent lay in my pen. In any case, I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>keep my notes--or perhaps no!--I must not deceive myself by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>harbouring an uncertain hope. I cannot accomplish what I have in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mind with the pen. The analysis of the complicated mechanism of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>human nature is contrary to my nature. My gift is to comprehend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beauty, to model it in clear and lovely forms.... I shall keep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>those notes to remind me of what I have seen, experienced, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>suffered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"If the art of sculpture fails me I will humiliate myself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and seek out, wherever he may be, the man (his name is Mark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Volokov) who first doubted the completion of my novel and will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>confess to him, 'You are right, right, I am only half a man!'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But until that time comes, I will live and hope.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Let us go to Rome, Rome. There dwells Art, not snobbishness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and empty pastime; there is work, enjoyment, life itself. To our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>early meeting!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The house was early astir to bid Raisky Godspeed. Tushin and the young</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vikentevs had come, Marfinka, a marvel of beauty, amiability and shyness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tatiana Markovna looked sad, but she pulled herself together and avoided</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sentiment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Stay with us," she said reproachfully. "You do not even know, yourself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>where you are going."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To Rome, Grandmother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What for? To see the Pope?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To be a sculptor."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Wha-at?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka also begged him to stay. Vera did not add her voice to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>request, because she knew he would not stay; she thought sorrowfully</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>that his manifold talents had not developed so far to give the pleasure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>they should do to himself and others.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Cousin," she said, "if ever you grow weary of your existence abroad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will you come back to glance at this place where you are now at last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>understood and loved?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Certainly I will, Vera. My heart has found a real home here.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Grandmother, Marfinka and you are my dear family; I shall never form new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>domestic ties. You will always be present with me wherever I go, but now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>do not seek to detain me. My imagination drives me away, and my head is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>whirling with ideas, but in less than a year I shall have completed a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>statue of you in marble."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What about the novel?" she asked, laughing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"When I am dead anyone who has a fancy for them may examine my papers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and will find material enough. But my immediate intention is to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>represent your head and shoulders in marble."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Before the year is out you will fall in love with somebody else, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will not know which to choose as your model."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I may fall in love, but I shall never love anyone as I do you. I will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>carve your statue in marble, for you always stand vividly before my eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>That is certain," he concluded emphatically, as he caught her smiling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>glance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Certain again!" interrupted Tatiana Markovna. "I don't know what you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>are discussing there, but I know that when you say 'certain,' Boris, it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is safe to say that nothing will come of it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky went up to Tushin, who was sitting in a corner silently watching</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the scene.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I hope, Ivan Ivanovich, that what we all wish will be accomplished," he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"All of us, Boris Pavlovich? Do you think it will be accomplished?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I think so; it could hardly be otherwise. Promise to let me know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>wherever I am, because I wish to hold the marriage crown over Vera's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>head at the ceremony."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And I promise to come."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leonti took Raisky on one side, gave him a letter for Juliana Andreevna,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and begged him to seek her out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Speak to her conscience," he said. "If she agrees to return, telegraph</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to me, and I will travel to Moscow to meet her."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky promised, but advised him, in the meantime, to rest and to spend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the winter with Tushin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The whole party surrounded the travelling carriage. Marfinka wept</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>copiously, and Vikentev had already provided her with no less than five</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>handkerchiefs. When Raisky had taken his seat he looked out once more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and exchanged glances with Tatiana Markovna, with Vera and with Tushin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The common experience and suffering of the six months, which had drawn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>them so closely together, passed before his vision with the rapidity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the varying tone and colour, and the vagueness of a dream.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHAPTER XXXVII</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>As soon as Raisky reached St. Petersburg he hurried off to find Kirilov.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He felt an impulse to touch his friend to assure himself that Kirilov</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>really stood before him, and that he had not started on the journey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without him. He repeated to him his ardent confidence that his artistic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>future lay in sculpture.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What new fancy is this?" asked Kirilov, frowning and plainly expressing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his mistrust. "When I got your letter I thought you were mad. You have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>one talent already; why do you want to follow a sidetrack. Take your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pencil, go to the Academy, and buy this," he said, showing him a thick</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>book of lithographed anatomical drawings. "What do you want with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>sculpture? It is too late."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I feel I have the right touch here," he said, rubbing his fingers one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>against the other.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Whether you have the right touch or not, it is too late."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why too late? There is an ensign I know who wields the chisel with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>great success."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"An ensign, yes! But you, with your grey hair...." Kirilov emphasised</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his remarks with a vigorous shake of the head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky would wrangle with him no longer. He spent three weeks in the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>studio of a sculptor, and made acquaintance with the students there. At</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>home he worked zealously; visited with the sculptor and his students the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Isaac Cathedral, where he stood in admiration before the work of Vitali;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and he spent many hours in the galleries of the Hermitage. Overwhelmed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>with enthusiasm he urged Kirilov to start at once for Italy and Rome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had not forgotten Leonti's commission, and sought out Juliana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Andreevna in her lodgings. When he entered the corridor he heard the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>strains of a waltz and, he thought, the voice of Koslov's wife. He sent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in his name and with it Leonti's letter. After a time the servant, with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>an air of embarrassment, came to tell him that Juliana Andreevna had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>gone with a party of friends to Zarskoe-Selo, and would travel direct</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>from there to Moscow. Raisky did not think it necessary to mention this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>incident to Leonti.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>His former guardian had sent him a considerable sum raised by the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>mortgage of his estate, and with this in hand he set out with Kirilov at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the beginning of January for Dresden. He spent many hours of every day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>in the gallery, and paid an occasional visit to the theatre. Raisky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>pressed his fellow-traveller to go farther afield; he wanted to go to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Holland, to England, to Paris.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What should I do in England?" asked Kirilov. "There, all the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>art-treasures are in private galleries to which we have no access, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>public museums are not rich in great works of art. If you are determined</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to go, you must go by yourself from Holland. I will wait for you in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paris."</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Raisky agreed to this proposition. He only stayed a fortnight in England,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>however, and was very much impressed by the mighty sea of social life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then he hastened back to his eager study of the rich art treasures of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paris; but he could not possess his soul in the confusion and noisy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>merriment, in the incessant entertainments of Paris.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the early spring the friends crossed the Alps. Even while he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>abandoned himself to the new impressions which nature, art, and a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>different race made on his mind, Raisky found that the dearest and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>nearest ties still connected him with Tatiana Markovna, Vera and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Marfinka. When he watched the towering crests of the waves at sea or the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>snow-clad mountain tops his imagination brought before him his aunt's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>noble grey head; her eyes looked at him from the portraits of Velasquez</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and Gerard Dow, just as Murillo's women reminded him of Vera, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>recalled Marfinka's charming face as he looked at the masterpieces of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Greuze, or even at the women of Raphael. Vera's form flitted before him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the mountain side; he saw once more before him the precipice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>overlooking the narrow plain of the Volga, and fought over again the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>despairing struggle from which he had emerged. In the flowery valleys</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vera beckoned to him under another aspect, offering her hand with her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>affectionate smile. So his memories followed him even as he contemplated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the mighty figures of Nature, Art and History as they were revealed in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the mountains and the plains of Italy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>He gave himself up to these varied emotions with a passionate absorption</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which shook the foundations of his physical strength. In Rome he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>established himself in a studio which he shared with Kirilov, and spent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>much of his time in visiting the museums and the monuments of antiquity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sometimes he felt he had suddenly lost his appreciation of natural</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>beauty, and then he would shut himself up and work for days together.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Another time he was absorbed in the crowded life of the city, which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>appeared to him as a great, crude, moving picture in which the life of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>bygone centuries was reflected as in a mirror.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>Through all the manifestations of this rich and glowing existence he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>remained faithful to his own family, and he was never more than a guest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on the foreign soil. In his leisure hours his thoughts were turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>homewards; he would have liked to absorb the eternal beauty of nature</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and art, to saturate himself with the history revealed in the monuments</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>of Rome in order that he might take his spiritual and artistic gains</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>back to Malinovka.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The three figures of Vera, Marfinka, and his "little mother" Tatiana</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Markovna, stretched out beckoning hands to him; and calling him to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>herself with even greater insistence than these, was another, mightier</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>figure, the "great mother," Russia herself.</p>

<p>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance</p>

<p>can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the</p>

<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!</p>

<p>Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.</p>

<p>ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>distribute it in the United States without permission and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>any commercial products without permission.</p>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<empty-line/>
<p>To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged</p>
<empty-line/>
